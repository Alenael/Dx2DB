"Adramelech","P","P","4","2","2","5","5","Sun God's Majesty punishes any form of MP restore, burning 1 MP and dealing 30% Fractional damage to their entire team, while also renewing Barriers for your team. This makes him an incredibly strong counter to MP-batteries like Alice A, Angra Mainyu and Beelzebub☆.
In addition, Sun God's Majesty provides him Fire Pierce and more importantly +25% to Fire damage - this gives him a whopping +60% to Fire damage in Purple, even with ZERO transfers and ZERO panels. When combined with Sacrificial Inferno's colossal Base Power (which also ignores Endures), Adramelech can easily nuke down any target he chooses.
But wait, there's more! Sun God's Majesty also provides a 3-turn Luster Candy at the start of battle, aiding you in winning the buff war. With Panel 2 unlocked, it further chains into a 3-turn Debilitate, literally swinging every buff by himself for free.
To cap it off, Sun God's Majesty gives him +20% Max HP if fully levelled. Paired with his passable VIT-stat and innate Fire Survivor, this makes him surprisingly bulky, especially if Epitome of Endurance is transferred.","Weak to Ice unless Teal.
High AGI makes him awkward to fit into slow teams, more or less mandating Epitome of Endurance.
Sun God's Majesty doesn't really counter Demeter's 2 MP restore from My Harvest!. Not only does her team still gain 1 MP, they also take only a net 5% fractional damage from Adra's effect (he deals 30% fractional, then Demeter responds with 25% fractional Bulwarks). My Harvest itself also sets up a 20% HP Bulwark, so at most Adra can only hope to take off 10% of the foe's actual HP bar this way.","Remember when we thought Warlord's Wrath was overloaded? Sun God's Majesty literally exceeds Twitter's character limit."
"Alice","TP","TP","4","2","2","4","5","Die for Me! inflicts Mortal (instant kill), has pierce, and bypasses Endure-type skills, making her incredibly valuable for deleting key demons in PvP.
High MAG stat combined with Dark Amp in Purple makes her a very powerful Dark Mage.
Incredible panels that give her damage amplification, MP cost reduction, and increased uses of her signature unique skill.
Panel 4 makes DFM trigger a second DFM as a chain effect, meaning she can score 2 mortal kills per cast. Even if an enemy doesn't die to mortal, Alice still effectively doubles her damage output per DFM cast.
She's cute!!","Ideally wants to be run with Divines or an MP battery demon, along with P2, to spam Die for Me! as much as possible.
Die for Me! has only one charge unless P3 is unlocked, limiting her usefulness at low panels. This is especially a problem in scenarios where she cannot be Panelled, such as Tokyo Abyss.","Cannot be used in the same team as Alice A.
She has pretty bad AI (will sometimes Mamudoon instead of spamming DFM), keep this in mind when using her for Defense.
Mortal is lot less powerful against units like Xi Wangmu, Demeter, Maria, and Shaddai, all who are key defensive demons currently. However, there are key attackers that are vulnerable so she does have use.
As of 2022, she's multi-fusible, but only Common Archetype (Clear) and at an approximate cost of 8 million mag per copy (3 million of that is unaffected by discounts), making it slow and expensive to fully Panel her."
"Alice A","T","TP","5","3","3","1","2","One of few demons with an AOE Mortal, and the only one who can cast it T1. When paired with curse support like Nebiros, she can easily annihilate entire teams without Null Curse and/or Null Mortal.
Drains 2 MP from the enemy at the start of their turn, which can prevent T1 sweepers from having immediate access to their skills.
Trivializes almost all PvE content like Aura Gate and Hell's Park - pair her with an AOE curse inflictor and instakill everyone!
Purple gains Null Mortal which prevents her from being killed by other Mortal users.
P2 gives her team a 1 MP battery every time an enemy is defeated.
She's cute!!","Hard countered by Null Curse and Null Mortal. Demeter preventing ailments while bulwark is active, while also being a powerful mp battery essentially removed Alice A's role in pvp.","Cannot be used in the same team as OG Alice."
"Alilat","C","C","4","2","2","1","1","While alive, Repel Pierce will prevent Pierce skills from going through Repel resistances. This is very useful when combined with demons that have high natural Repels (like Asura Lord or Vairocana) or against popular attack elements like Physical (example Teal Gogmagog).
Very high Luck stat allows her to be used as both an Ailment inflictor and a cleanser (especially with innate Infernal Mask and P1, which together grant -110% chance of receiving ailments).
Good HP and VIT stats and no weaknesses give her a lot of bulk. Panels 2, 3, 4, and levels on Repel Pierce increase her bulk further.
Panel 4 grants Alilat a free self-heal whenever she or an ally repels an attack, helping her stay alive.
Very cheap to fuse, at only about 1 million magnetite per copy from scratch - the cheapest fusible 5★ in the game.","Megidola is a wasted skill as her Magic stat is low.
Attribute affinity down completely shuts down her niche.","One of the few demons that can negate Pierce, and the only fusible one. A near Must-Have demon for PvE, as Repel Pierce paired with appropriate demons is perfect for cheesing most Boss fights."
"Amaterasu","Y","C","2","1","1","3","3","Tenson Korin is a powerful buff that removes debuffs then gives your team a 6 turn Luster Candy
Mediarahan in yellow costs only 8, letting her cast it every other turn with Divine brands.
Panel 4 gives Tenson Korin a 1 turn Zenith, making her the only fusible source of Zenith.","Maragion is a waste in support builds
Her MP costs are absurdly high and completely outclassed by Barong
Has elec weakness, making her even more of a liability in PvE.
Healing isn't particularly valuable in PvP, and her high costs make her nigh worthless there.
Her Zenith only lasts one turn, compared to the 6 turns of every other buff on the skill.
Absolute garbage panels.","How the mighty have fallen. If any launch player could imagine saying Just make Barong, Amaterasu is useless you'd be told you're crazy."
"Amon","RP","YRP","4","3","3","4","3","Immensely tanky. Between every skill and panel, he has a potential 130% HP boost, along with having the 2nd highest VIT in the game. Additionally, Demonic Flame's Aid also reduces magic damage received by 40% and grants Fire Pierce, while additionally giving him a 1500 HP up to 4 times per battle when hit by a magic or fractional damage attack. On top of that, after the end of the first enemy turn, it grants Concentrate.
Abyss Flare and Abyss Flame uniquely scale off of Mag DEF instead of Mag ATK, while both ignoring endures. Additionally Abyss Flare has Remnants. This skill can easily counter sweep a T1 team combined with his Concentrate if he survives.
Low AGI at 116 and innate Epitome of Endurance really solidify his role as a powerful tank, meant to power through even the strongest teams like Elohim and Mithras.
Less competition for Brands compared to your other demons, as he relies on MDEF for damage.
Extremely powerful panels that give him nearly everything he needs, granting Null Mortal, Null Bind, up to 650 flat MDEF, more damage reduction in bulwark, along with extra HP and Fire damage.","Not even he is necessarily tanky enough to fully withstand assaults from Elohim and Mithras due to the sheer damage those teams can put out.
While he's strong against T1 teams, he can struggle to be useful against T2 teams, especially those reliant on Phys damage.
Only defends against Bind, and can be vulnerable to being muted or charmed.
Panels are a pretty big deal with how powerful they are.
Requires brands that balance between HP and Mag DEF in order to optimize his tankiness.","-"
"Anahita","RP","YP","4","3","3","5","5","Reasonably fast, with 202 agi and Ice Accele, along with 20% more speed in P1, helping cement her role as a T1 magic nuker.
Has extremely endure piercing high ST ice damage in Hell Stream, which additionally gives her team some buff control if the attack is successful.
Aqua Grace not only gives her team a turn of 400HP Bulwark, but also gives anybody with a bulwark 30% magic damage boost, letting her team do massive magic damage, extremely useful for democalypse.
Solar Downfall in yellow and Ice Amp in purple both work well with her role as a fast damage dealer.
BoS Avarice is made for her, with her cheap, massive single target ice damage.
Has strong synergy with magic T1 teams with Elohim, Nyarlathotep, Vishnu A, and Mithras.","She's a fast demon with a bulwark, which is really a role mismatch. A 400 hp bulwark isn't keeping a fast team alive.
For her to do her best in democ, she needs to have P2, because she only has a bulwark for 1 turn without it, meaning her team won't take full advantage of her damage boost.
She's not super fast, meaning she'll lower your speed compared to some of the faster demons.
T1 is currently not in the meta, limiting her usage, even with her bulwark gimmick seemingly synergizing with Demeter.","-"
"Ananta","R","P","3","2","2","4","3","He casts all 3 Buffs at the start of both his team's turn and the enemy team's turn, offering consistent buff control at no MP cost.
Panel 4 also casts Debilitate at the start of the enemy turn, or when your team casts any skill with a healing effect - this includes life steal and chain effects, such as Seth's Ouas or Huang Di's panel 3. (This does NOT include Lydia, however).
Mabufudyne in Red plus Infinite Chakra helps him pull his weight beyond just being a buffbot in Ice Democalypse prelim. He also performs decently in any other element, except Phys.
Works well in slow double Intimidating Stance teams, providing buff control simply by staying alive, which Demeter can practically guarantee. Could be a decent Tetraja holder.
Even though he auto-casts all buffs at the start of your turn, Auto-Taruka in purple for pvp is still his best. Because of the timing of Endless One, Auto-Taruka can function mainly to counter the enemy Auto-Tarunda to ensure you get the attack buff from Endless One at the start of your turn.","Weak to Force.
Mag is only average and he has no innate pierce, so even if Red he's still more of a support than a sweeper.
Newer demons have buff chains on their skills, which may reduce Ananta's niche.
Offers nothing more than buff control in pvp.","-"
"Anat","P","CP","4","2","2","5","3","Thunderstorm deals high piercing AOE damage and autocasts Tarunda. This is further augmented by innate Elec Amp, making her a terrifying Elec sweeper.
Killer Impulse lets her function as an Endure breaker, and has great synergy with Hresvelgr.
Merciless Blow in purple is incredible for Elec Democalypse.
Zeus and his attribute affinity down help her hit weakness making her Merciless Blow in purple more valuable again.","Weak to Force unless Teal.
Expensive to fuse and only available in clear (approx 8 million mag per copy, 5 million of that is unaffected by discounts). Colored variants are Gacha exclusive.
Only Thunderstorm and Killer Impulse have Pierce.
Will have MP issues with Thunderstorm unless Panel 2 and with MP support.
Even though she might seem to have good synergy with Zeus, she just doesn't hit hard enough to deal with Demeter's bulwarks and her aoe and chain in Killer Impulse can actually make the bulwark situation worse.","Red gives her discounted Thunder Reign which can be used against Elec Anti-Pierce such as Rama + Mother Harlot. Note that it does not pierce though!
Killer Impulse can be denied by having Endure on all demons. This is becoming more commonplace after the introduction of Survivor skills."
"Angra Mainyu","TR","TP","3","2","2","1","1","Everything Evil is an incredibly powerful passive that gives your whole team 3 MP at the beginning of the turn. Not only does this counter the MP Drain from Alice A's Give me Jewels, it also allows your team to run Spell/War brands instead of Divine for more damage.
16 Scourges chips off 25% of Max HP from the opposing team and inflicts them with every single ailment in the game. The chip damage helps your main sweeper to clean up, while the Ailments can be used to set up for demons like Alice A and Pale Rider.
When used with Atavaka or Alilat, innate Repel Elec helps to soft-counter Atropos, as the second part of Passionate Rage will not proc if the first Elec part is Anti-Pierced.
Thanks to his High Luck and Infernal Mask in Purple, he can be run as a Pseudo Cleric if Prayer is transferred (preferably with another Ailment Resist passive like Epitome of Illusion).
Panel 2 provides a single turn Luster Candy in addition to the 2 MP, making it even easier for your team to sweep.","Weak to Light unless Teal.
Not very useful for PvE as his passive has limited uses, and Ailments generally fall flat late game due to inflated enemy stats.
He doesn't have any form of Barrier Break in his kit, meaning someone else with it has to go before him, or else his ailments won't stick.
16 Scourges deals fractional damage, which doesn't scale from MATK, meaning that his high Magic stat is wasted without transferred skills.
Demeter essentially removed him from pvp, doing a better job as an MP battery while simultaneously preventing him from using ailments, while negating his fractional damage with bulwarks.","Be very wary of any enemy Daisoujou, as he will respond with a Mute Counter the moment you fire off 16 Scourges. This can severely mess you up if your sweepers end up getting Muted."
"Aniel","P","P","4","2","2","2","5","Glorious Bolt restores 1 MP to the whole party (including himself) and costs a measly 5 MP to activate.
Innate Thunderclap and Light Enhancement in Purple make him a powerful nuker for Light Democalypse.
Panel 3 unlocks a damage aura for your other Archangels, further elevating the damage ceiling of that team composition, especially in Democalypse.
God's Grace creates an Almighty Repel Magic effect on the team, which can counter the enemy Demeter.","God's Grace requires him to have two Archangels on his team to activate, severely limiting his teambuilding. Even worse, many Archangels have low damage chain effects on turn start, which will create more bulwarks through Demeter.","-"
"Apsu","P","YP","4","4","3","3","5","The First Drop is a strong passive granting Ice Pierce, 100% crit rate, 50% battle speed, and a unique effect which places all allies in a state of Lydia at the start of the first turn, increasing their MP gain by 1 while they have Lydia, and giving them 20% damage reduction and ailment immunity. On top of this, the first time his team downs a demon each turn, he generates a press turn.
Primordial Vortex is a strong 300 BP Physical Ice attack, that also casts a one turn Debilitate if successful and ignore endures. Since this can crit, it can do a massive amount of ST damage.
Functions similarly to a weaker Demeter, offering MP support, ailment immunity, damage reduction, and healing instead of a bulwark.
Gains even more speed in panels, along with a self bulwark when going first, more damage, HP, and accuracy.","Demeter outclasses him in nearly every way. She offers much more MP, and while he does have more personal damage and in theory his healing is more effective against bulwark piercing attacks, in practice it isn't enough to make a difference.
169 AGI is extremely low for his battle speed boosting effects. He's nowhere near as good as boosting speed as other speedy demons like Astaroth.
Ultimately compared to the meta demons, while he's far from useless, he's just outclassed, outside of Ice Democ.","-"
"Ardha","TP","T","4","4","4","1","5","Sahasrara is an incredibly stacked passive that provides additional MP regen, damage, hit rate and healing effectiveness. Additionally, when any member of the party uses a skill that recovers HP, Ardha chains a 60 BP Phys skill with 50% crit rate that scales on Mag ATK and ignores counters.
This has powerful synergy with Vivian, who will chain a heal letting you start to chain effects. Other options to add to this combo include Kangiten, along with the Lakshmi A and Mithras combo. This leads to a strong T0 comp that can wipe a team before a single turn even happens.
Ruin and Grace is a very hard-hitting ST skill that has a high critical rate and heals your whole party if it hits, and ignores counters and endures. Combined with high natural MAG and innate Epitome of Carnage, Ardha can deal massive damage while keeping your party healthy.
Naturally drains Fire and Elec while gaining Drain Phys in Teal. This makes Ardha an incredible partner for Demiurge.
Can be used in Phys Democalypse as a powerful boss unit, especially in Purple for Merciless Blow.
P3 adds additional MP regen, making Ardha regen 5 MP per turn, baseline.","The extra Phys hit granted by Sahasrara does not bypass Endures.
Does not hit hard enough to be worth running against Demeter in pvp.
Drain Elec doesn't matter against Zeus.","Run Ardha with Lakshmi A to give your whole team near unlimited MP."
"Arioch","TYP","Any","3","3","3","5","3","Has a huge hp barrier on the first turn, making it a challenge for T1 teams to kill him, especially when paired with revivers like Xi Wangmu or Maria
Perfect for T2 teams, with Intimidating Stance, incredibly low agi, and innate Epitome of Endurance.
His abilities scale off of max HP, allowing him to do huge amounts of damage based off his hp.
At the end of the opponents first turn, he enters a state of Charge and Rebellion, meaning his next hit will hit like a truck, and he additionally chips at their Max hp
Both of his unique attacks go through endures, making it easier for him to sweep with Lionfall.
His panels are great, making him even harder to kill and giving him much needed accuracy. In particular damage reduction while under bulwark has good synergy with Demeter.
Red has both ST and AoE making it easier for him to avoid anti pierce.","64 agi is nice for going slow, but it means he's also completely blind. Needs a ton of accuracy and buff control to hit evasive targets, especially with evasion popular in the current meta
Lionfall does not have mp reduction in levels, and this can be abused by players using mp drain like Mind Break.
High hp totals mean fractional damage skills are going to hit harder on him.
Has some ai issues when anti-pierce comes into play, which can lead to him wasting his Charge and Rebellion combo on an auto attack
Only gets his Charge and Rebellion effect once. After his big hit, his damage is effectively neutered making him hard to use against Demeter.","-"
"Asherah","TP","TY","3","3","3","2","2","Mother's Creation revives a unit with full HP while also generating a Press Turn, allowing the resurrected unit to act immediately.
Silent Prayer in Yellow allows her to act as a Pseudo-Cleric and also removes Barrier, Tetraja, Charge etc. This can work well with Gozu-Tennoh, though he is currently less popular in PvP.
Innate Mediarama and Recovery Amp in Purple lets her function as a decent PvE Healer.
Gains a lot through panels, including 70% hp helping her tank, Null Mortal, an extra use of Mother Creation, and 70% fire reduction, helping her survive Elohim and Mithras teams, and revive those that did die to counter sweep.","Weak to Ice (unless Teal) and Dark.
Low AGI means she will need Lead Brands or even slower teammates to work as a Cleric.
Requires Panel 4's Null Mortal and HP boost to make her a reliable tank in today's meta.","Beware revive sealing units who can render Mother's Creation useless."
"Astaroth","Any","TP","5","5","5","5","5","Demons die when they are killed by Lord Astaroth, letting him be a hard counter to revive teams that don't have Maria
When enemies die, he offers powerful buff control, swinging both attack and evasion buffs and debuffs in his team's favor. In addition to this, the first time an enemy dies, he gives his team a press turn, allowing for tons of press turns when partnered with demons like Zeus.
Lord Astaroth has high damage, doing 250 damage total with bonus crit rate. The second hit can also be used to check evasive targets without risking press turns. With max skill level and panel 1, its cost can be reduced to 4 mp, meaning when paired with Maria, he can use it every turn even with War brands.
With the third highest AGI in the game, and 70% battle speed built into his kit with 20% more in panels, he's going to make your teams fast. This is currently his strongest use, boosting team speed while also offering a press turn and buff control.
He has 100% crit rate built right into his kit, meaning unless he's against Epitome of Fortitude or Wild Instinct, he's essentially guaranteed to crit.
Amazing panels, with the aforementioned mp reduction in p1, a huge party crit rate and hit rate buff in p2, and even more speed and damage in p3
Amazing awaken skills, offering aoe mp drain, buff control, damage, or Repel Phys, depending on what you need","Red's awaken skill Cleaving Aura, while a great MP drain skill, performs poorly in the current meta. Demeter will just re-cast Bulwarks and buffs, and give her team the 2 MP back when she casts My Harvest!. Kalki's unpiercable Drain Phys makes the move unusable when facing him. On defense, Astaroth's AI will also use Cleaving Aura to attack into ndr, limiting his own team's actions.
T1 teams built with him have to choose between speed, or being able to deal with the bulk of Maria and Demeter teams, meaning randoming can be risky
His damage has fallen off, and often now is more used for his supportive effects.
tantly chains effects, slowing down pve clear times
No innate Mara","-"
"Asura","R","T","4","1","1","4","5","High STR and Ashura are devastating against lone targets like Bosses. This makes him a very strong Phys Democalypse unit. P4 offers even more damage once per turn.
Three Faces Six Arms and his good innate bulk are the perfect counter to skills like Fire of Sinai in Brands of Sin Deceit, and the buffed 50% HP helps him tank it.
Mana Aid is fantastic for PvE farming as it lets him spam Ashura.
Single-handedly trivializes Brands of Sin Deceit.
Repel Phys in Teal and high VIT make him a good partner for Atavaka, Alilat, Demiurge, and Kalki","Weak to Ice.
As nothing in his kit boosts damage, damage booster transfers are mandatory.
Until P3, Ashura costs 7 mp, making it expensive to spam.","His only Piercing attack being Random Target makes him near unusable in PvP. He will tickle Demeter's bulwark and just give her more."
"Asura Lord","RP","TP","5","3","3","5","3","Incredibly high ST damage that also generates Press Turns thanks to his high Crit Rate.
Passively increases your team's Crit Rate and Crit Damage through Endless War. Pairs very well with Kartikeya, as their combined passives will give your team a whopping +40% boost to Crit Rate.
Slaughter All can only be blocked by two demons (Beelzebub (Human) and Griffith) and ignores Endure-type skills, allowing you to delete any demon he claps. It is also very useful to clean up any remaining enemies (usually bosses) after your AOE demons have unleashed their payload, notably BoS Deceit Metatron.
Red gives him a powerful AOE in Gigantomachia. Combined with his innate Great Aim and Pierce in Endless War, this makes him a terrifying sweeper.
Good repel resistances makes him a natural partner for Alilat, Atavaka, Kalki, or Demiurge.
With panels, he offers his team a total of 60% critical hit rate, helping out teams like Hachiman Democalypse prelim teams. With Endless War also offering Tarukaja and Rakunda, he's a natural pairing for him.","Hard to raise Slaughter All's damage further as it is of the Almighty element.
High MP cost mandates the use of Divine Brands if Panel 2 is not unlocked, which can slightly reduce his damage potential.
Middling AGI makes him slightly awkward to fit in fast or slow teams.","Red also helps against Beelzebub (Human), as it gives Asura Lord a way to keep doing significant damage despite Lord of the Dead's barrier. Beware of Anti-Pierce, though!"
"Atavaka","TP","P","4","2","2","1","1","While alive, War Aid will prevent Pierce skills from going through Repel resistances. This is very useful when combined with demons that have high natural Repels (like Asura Lord or Vairocana) or against popular attack elements like Physical (example Teal Gogmagog).
Intimidating Stance is a very powerful passive for PvP and synergizes with his low AGI.
Enemy Annihilation fully debuffs enemies before chaining into a piercing physical AOE sweep. Because the AOE is a chain effect, you will not lose Press Turns even if it misses and/or hits into Phys NDR+Anti-Pierce, allowing him to spam it without concern.","Weak to Ice unless Teal.
Very high MP costs. Running Divine sets hurt his overall damage and/or Bulk.
Does not have natural Pierce. This can cause issues with his AI attacking into Tetra Shift and/or Physical NDR when out of MP.
Stiff competition from Demiurge, who not only has Drain Pierce, not only has Repel Pierce and two powerful passives, but also has Null Mortal.
Attribute affinity down completely shuts down his niche.","One of few demons that can negate Pierce. He is also the only one with Intimidating Stance."
"Atropos","P","RP","2","2","2","3","3","Passionate Rage dishes out massive damage before the battle even really begins. Since it triggers at the start of the opponent turn, she can easily kill frail Turn 1 Sweepers, especially if combined with the buff swing from Lachesis' Passionate Embrace.
Severed Fate deals Piercing Single Target damage and will automatically target Fire, Ice, Elec or Force weaknesses. Combined with innate Merciless Blow, she can heavily punish any demons who leave a weakness open.
Purple gives her Infinite Chakra, allowing her to spam Severed Fate repeatedly even while on Spell Brands. Red gives her access to discounted Judgement, useful if you want an AOE to compliment her passive chains.
Her Panels provide valuable ailment immunity, making it harder for Ailment Teams to sweep her on revenge.","If the first Elec part of Passionate Rage is Anti-Pierced (for example Rama-Mother Harlot, Atavaka-Aniel), the second Fire part will not proc, literally halving her damage.
Requires a good team built around her to work.
Awkward mix of 4 Elements plus having both ST and AOE skills makes it difficult to boost her damage outside Elemental Cycle.
As Press Turns are calculated based on the number of demons alive at the start of the turn, any demons who survive Passionate Rage will gain access to multiple Press turns. Several demons like Guts and Anat can abuse this to reverse sweep instead.
Her chains are not very effective against Demeter as they don't do enough damage, and will end up just creating more bulwarks","-"
"Azazel","T","TP","2","1","1","4","3","The only demon in the game with access to two innate Endures in Purple. He can stack up to 5 Endures with transcend as a result, giving him immense survivability as long as it is not bypassed.
Fallen Grigori provides him HP and MP sustain every turn (as long as he is below the 80% threshold). Combined with his Endure stacks, this can make him very difficult to kill.
Guillotine Blaze is a low MP single target Fire Nuke that pierces, ignores Endures and has high crit rate. This is further augmented by innate Fire Amp and constant Rebellion from Fallen Grigori.
Panel 2 fire off a free Guillotine Blaze every turn, letting him deal extra damage without consuming MP.","Weak to Elec, which many units can abuse.
Damage is lackluster in Fire Democalypse Boss Phase, as the Boss has +100% Crit Resist.
Only Guillotine Blaze has Pierce.
Many damage skills completely ignore Endures, negating a huge portion of his kit. This also applies to skills with Mortal effect.
Mortal could make him useful in theory against certain attackers but with a 10% chance, there's simply no point in gambling on it. Additionally, his chain effect in P2 is a liability against Demeter teams as it will just trigger bulwarks, as his damage isn't high enough.","Red provides him discounted Maragidyne, giving him access to an AoE skill for PvE and/or Democalypse. Note that it will not pierce though!"
"Baal","P","RP","4","2","2","5","5","Tempest deals high piercing AOE damage and autocasts Sukunda.
Rains of Canaan provides a teamwide Force damage boost.

Good single target piercing physical damage in Physical Hunt, which also drains 3 mp, allowing him to drain potentially 7 mp from a target in a single turn, or four from two.
Decent bulk with a good vit stat, innate Epitome of Fortitude, along with additional hp% from panels, and a built in endure with hp% in levels, combined with null mortal, can keep him alive draining MP
Offers some buff control with p2
Flexible with his colors, with each color offering different uses, letting him flex into many different teams.","Because he drains mp at the start of his team's turn, he won't steal mp from a T1 team, potentially letting him get swept in a single turn.
His agi is too high for a slow team, but slow for a fast team, making him hard to slot into pvp teams.
While far from weak, his damage is low compared to the highest tier of damage dealers, and the mp drain doesn't really counteract that enough to warrant a slot in a team.
Has decent bulk and decent damage, but isn't exceptional enough at either of them to excel at anything.","Only gains phys pierce in p1, meaning his auto attacks or Vorpal Blade in red are a liability without his panels
Limited-time Collaboration unit. Nobody knows if he will be rerun."
"Barong","T","Any","5","3","3","3","3","Barong Dance provides a decent AOE heal while giving the party a full Luster Candy buff. It also has infinite uses and can be reduced to a mere 5 MP when maxed with Panel 1 unlocked.
Panel 4 makes Barong Dance apply a 1-turn 500 HP Bulwark, which can stack to 1,000 HP if you get 2 casts off during your turn. This increases the value of his heal significantly, as you can set up bulwarks to soak damage while patching up teammates at the same time, particularly helping him keep frail targets alive. With the addition of Demeter extra bulwark strength is greatly appreciated
Very high AGI allows him to be used as a fast support, especially with Speedster transferred for Battle Speed requirements.
Can be used as a buffer for Elec Democalypse thanks to Barong Dance having high cast priority.
Works decently in the current meta against Zeus and Odin A as he gives the entire party 20% elec damage reduction, on top of 70% for himself.","Weak to Dark (unless Teal) and Force.
Low MAG stat means he won't heal for much.
Elec attack spells (and Elec Amp in Purple) are wasted slots considering his bad Magic stat.
Does not have Null Mortal like some of his competition, particularly Maria.
Only has one revive in Recarmdra in yellow, and can be vulnerable to having teammates Revive Sealed.","Niche use in Aura Gate as giving him Support AI with his MATK low enough guarantees he'll heal you with Barong Dance no matter your HP. This is useful to recover HP lost from Talk and/or enemy encounters."
"Batou","P","P","2","1","1","2","5","Tachikoma Support gives him a whopping +75% Battle Speed and autocasts a two-turn Rakunda + Sukunda when going first, making him very useful for Fast Teams.
Against single targets, SEBURO C-40A deals massive damage, totalling up to 320 Base Power - this is even higher than Hassou Tobi (280 BP) and Ashura (300 BP), and is further augmented by Death Blow in Purple.
Due to being coded as a conditional when attacking first skill (like Solars), Tachikoma Support will activate even during the Boss Phase in Democalypse. Combined with SEBURO C-40A's high base power, this makes him very useful for Phys Democalypse - provided you transfer another Single Target attack to use once he runs out of Seburo charges.
Panel 2 provides an additional Seburo charge and gives him additional accuracy + crit rate, very useful (and borderline mandatory) if going for a Democalypse boss build.
His middling AGI is both a blessing and a curse. On the plus side, having low AGI lets him go last in terms of turn order, where you can fully utilize SEBURO C-40A against softened / less targets. On the flip side however...","... Low base AGI means he won't be able to fully take advantage of the +75% Battle Speed from Tachikoma Support, roughly making him the equivalent of an uninvested P0 Garuda in terms of Battle Speed contribution.
Epitome of Fortitude is a laughably wasted skill on a Turn 1 unit.
Does nowhere near enough damage to even begin to puncture Demeter bulwarks.","If using for Democalypse, be aware that his AI will refuse to use Luster Candy on Turn 1, even with Support AI and massive VIT investment. This is likely due to [SEBURO C-40A]]'s insane base power affecting the AI's decision-making.
Limited-time Collaboration unit. Nobody knows if he will be rerun."
"Bayonetta☆","P","P","2","1","1","1","2","Madama Stomp levels and Savage Glee in Purple give her enormous crit rates.
Madama Stomp autocasts an Almighty attack that also charms whenever she lands a crit. Deals decent damage after being buffed to scale off her PATK.
Gomorrah (B) has high base damage and crit chance, letting you delete an enemy and charm the rest of the team.","Highly dependant on having Panel 2 unlocked for Phys Pierce.
Gomorrah (B) takes two turns to charge, and is difficult to build due to it scaling off both PATK and MATK.
Mediocre overall stats, bad bulk.
Same problem Jeanne☆ has. Gets completely outclassed even by fusable phys attackers like Fafnir, let alone other gacha only phys attackers, something that particularly sucks considering how rare of a unit she is.","Cannot be used in the same team as the regular 4★ Bayonetta.

"Beelzebub (Human)","P","YP","2","3","3","1","1","Lord of the Dead autocasts Almighty Tetrakarn and Rakukaja every turn. This is incredibly useful to counter Almighty Physical attackers like Shiva A and Skull Knight.
With Panel 2 unlocked, Lord of the Dead also reduces Piercing Physical damage as long as the barrier is up. This pretty much gives the team a 30% damage reduction from Physical Pierce, as most of them cannot remove Tetrakarn. This also applies to Elemental Physical attackers like Koga Saburo and Zeus.
Great Chaos deals piercing Dark damage to a single target which also Mutes them, before chaining into an AOE piercing Elec attack that binds whoever it hits. This provides him great ailment control, especially if Panel 1 is unlocked to provide the team a free Barrier Break.
Has good bulk thanks to decent VIT/HP stats and Lord of the Dead providing him a 500-HP Endure.
Purple gains Intimidating Stance which synergizes well with his low AGI.","His damage output is rather low, as nothing in his kit boosts it (outside of Panel 3) and his MAG stat is fairly average for a mage.
This is made worse by his kit having a combination of ST, AOE, Dark and Elec elements, making it even harder to augment his damage.
Heavily reliant on Panel 1 and 2 to shine, otherwise he is rather mediocre.
Doesn't have Null Mortal, and with Silent Prayer common in the meta, Tetraja isn't as useful as it used to be. This massively hurts him against Gozu-Tennoh teams.
Doesn't have any active skills other than Great Chaos, which can be a problem versus Demeter as his damage is very low and will just grant her team bulwarks, while it's unlikely to do any ailments with her ailment immunity under bulwark.
Beelzebub (Human) is a silly name.","Cannot be used in the same team as Beelzebub☆ or the regular 4★ Beelzebub."
"Beelzebub☆","Any","TP","5","3","3","4","5","Death Flyers deals Almighty AOE damage and ignores Endures. This makes him incredibly powerful for cleanup, especially after a big nuke like Morning Star or Third Eye. On top of that, it grows stronger with each passing turn, gaining increased damage on Turn 2 and AOE Mortal on Turn 3.
When going first, King of Hell provides him 3 MP and a free Offensive Cry debuff. If paired with Angra Mainyu, this effectively gives him FULL MP on Turn 1, paving the way for absurd combos like Concentrate into Death Flyers.
When going second, King of Hell acts as Intimidating Stance while providing the team a Defensive Cry buff, greatly increasing the team's survivability.
As if that wasn't enough, King of Hell also gives him an 800-HP Endure. Factoring in the healing from Panel 1, an Almighty Survivor transfer and his good defensive stats, Beelzebub☆ is one hard bug to squash.
Panel 2 provides him immunity to Charm, Bind and Mute, allowing him to be run as a Cleric if Prayer is transferred.
Purple gains Null Mortal which prevents him from being killed by other Mortal users. Teal gains access to Drain Phys, which can be useful for pairing with Demiurge.
The auto-Offensive Cry from King of Hell lasts 3 turns and triggers in both phases of Democalypse, making him a very powerful tech unit there.
Many demons in the current meta, such as Chi You, Beelzebub (Human), Barong, Zeus, and Odin A do not have Null Mortal, giving him a niche on defense teams to punish teams running those demons without Tetraja.","Middling AGI makes him awkward to slot in slow teams. ider an Epitome of Endurance transfer if you want to do so.
As his kit is entirely Almighty, Five Elements counters him pretty hard. Pairing him with a Demiurge with Panel 2 unlocked offsets this weakness though.
Heavily reliant on Panel 1 and 2 to shine, otherwise he is fairly easy to deal with.
Does not do much to Demeter teams other than aoe Mortal, so if he can't abuse that, he's a wasted slot.","Cannot be used in the same team as Beelzebub (Human) and the regular 4★ Beelzebub."

Sins of Sodom provides Fast-Debilitate if an enemy is cursed, which pairs perfectly with the 80% curse-rate of Flames of Gomorrah, or with Nebiros who can curse before your turn.
Panel 2 allows him to Crit indefinitely.","Weak to Ice.
Lack of ST skills gives him trouble with Fire Anti-Pierce like Atavaka-Vairocana or Rama-Surt.","Many PvE enemies including certain Bosses are not immune to curse, making him an insane Debuffer for PvE."
"Berserker Guts","TRP","TP","4","4","3","5","5","Berserk hits incredibly hard, sporting a massive combined 320 BP with high Crit Rate, which also ignores any Endures and counters. The attack being split between two hits can also be used to hit two targets, or potentially check with the second hit if you can hit an evasive target, without risking press turn loss. It is worth noting this skill has 3 uses only.
Good STR and decent AGI, combined with up to 50% battle speed in his kit solidify his role as a T1 sweeper.
Berserker Armor and Great Aim give him a massive amount of passive bonuses, including 50% Phys Damage, 100% crit rate, 40% damage reduction, 40% accuracy, and an Offensive Cry passive at the start of his turn. When combined with Demeter, he has 60% damage reduction, and Berserker Armor's self damage triggers her bulwark, mostly negating the self damage and giving the team another Luster Candy.
Death Blow in purple and Repel Phys in yellow have good use in different situations. Binge Eating in red can be useful if you run out of charges of Berserk.
Absolutely incredible panels. 35% more phys damage, 20% HP, Accuracy, Crit Rate, Damage Reduction, Battle Speed, 6 more uses of Berserk, and a press turn generation any time an opponent is downed take him from a strong sweeper to an Astaroth sidegrade, where he isn't as fast as Astaroth, but instead does higher damage and can generate a press turn every turn rather than just once. He also has much more defensive utility, with 80% damage reduction after P2 under Demeter's bulwark.
Transfers like Gigantomachia and Mana Aid or Phys Prana turn him into a pve beast.","Berserk only has three charges before P3, so if he misses, it's a huge loss.
Berserker Armor takes off 30% of his Max HP and the end of the opponent's turn, effectively turning him into a ticking time bomb. This can be mitigated by using Embattle Brands (only 1 Turn) or pairing him with demons that can cast Bulwark (e.g., P4 Barong, Demeter). The fractional damage will subtract from the Bulwark first, before touching his actual HP.
Panels are extremely important for him, and he's a limited collab unit
While his innate speed bonus is nice, battle speeds have escalated quite a bit since his original release, meaning he can potentially slow your team down.","Cannot be used in the same team as regular Guts.
Berserker Armor reduces ALL damage he takes by 40%. As damage reduction stacks additively, it is possible to reach over 100% AOE Reduction if combined with demons like Orcus + Slime and take literally zero damage (outside of Fractional damage).
Limited-time Collaboration unit. Nobody knows if he will be rerun.
Due to how powerful crits are in Phys Democalypse, he is a fantastic Prelim sweeper due to Berserker Armor's high crit boost, provided you transfer an AOE like Gigantomachia."

Yellow gains access to Concentrate to further increase his sweeping potential.
Innate Mabufudyne and Ice Amp in Purple lets him function as an excellent Ice Sweeper too, especially for Democalypse.
P4's MP battery, buffs, and team advantage vs Curse are useful for BoS Vanity 13 farming.","Weak to Light.

Black Beckoning has a low damage cap (3400 Max Damage combined). As a result, she will have trouble killing bulky units without additional damage support.

"Botis","YRP","YP","4","4","4","4","5","Good AGI, high MAG, and innate Elec Accele make him a clear choice for T1 Elec teams, making him a great teammate for Indrajit, Odin A, and Zeus.
Dark Eclipse Voltage adds Elec Pierce, Null Mute, Deadly Mute, and makes enemies take 40% more damage from Elec attacks, making him similar to an Elec Mithras. In addition, when he uses Accursed Lightning or Vile Lightning, or anybody on his team uses an elec skill, a one turn Debilitate is cast, along with a 50% chance aoe mute, and a 60 BP Elec attack on a single enemy.
Accursed Lightning is a 4 hit ST Elec skill with 280 total BP and 50% chance to mute with each hit. The multi-hit mute is particularly relevant because it can remove a Demeter's bulwark then inflict Mute.
Vile Lightning in red is an aoe version with 120 total BP, while Solar perity gives him buff control or Elec Debuff is more damage and ailment chance.
Strong panels, granting an automatic Barrier Break if his team goes first, Battle Speed, Buff control, damage, and ailment chance, everything he could need.

"Camael","RP","P","5","5","5","5","5","Camael is an incredibly powerful MP denier unit. With One Who Sees God, at the start of each enemy turn, he does a 60 BP Physical Light chain that bulwark pierces, drains 1 MP, and inflicts a new Spirit Chains of Indignation effect twice to the enemy with the lowest HP, raising their MP costs by 6, going over 10, and preventing passing. Each turn the opponent takes removes one stack. This means any demon that has a skill that costs over 4 will need to have a max MP of 11 or above to even begin to have a chance to cast their skills. This chain will only activate 3 times.
One Who Sees God additionally grants Light Pierce, 70% HP, 100% crit rate, and restores 2 MP to the team at the start of every turn. On top of that, it offers a Tarukaja and Rakunda effect at the start of each turn.
Impure Sword of Light is another Spirit Chain of Indignation source, doing 260 BP Physical Light damage with 50% crit rate, adding a stack of Spirit Chains of Indignation, and ignoring endures, while also generating a press turn once per turn.
Brightness Incarnate granting 20% light damage and 20% acc gives Camael exactly what he needs to help sweep and actually hit his attacks.
P1 makes Impure Sword of Light a 4mp skill, meaning it can potentially be cast even with Spirit Chains of Indignation effects on him, and the panel also grants Light damage. P2 grants Null Mortal and teamwide 20% acc, and P3 grants more damage and acc for Camael, making his panels useful, but not entirely mandatory either.
Versatile in every single kind of team, from slow teams to fast teams, because of his myriad of MP effects, high damage, press turn generation, and large health pool.
Null Phys and Tetra Shift transfers can help punish demons that don't have Phys Pierce affected by Spirit Chains of Indignation. Consider stacking these effects and teammate evasion to help keep your team alive.","His effects are all physical, meaning he needs accuracy investment on top of damage and potentially bulk to survive.
Even with Demeter and P1, he still can't cast Impure Sword of Light immediately if he's affected by an enemy Spirit Chains of Indignation on the first turn if his team goes first, so going second can be very important. Phys Pierce (weak) transfers can help alleviate these issues.","-"

This effect devastates T1 teams, nearly guaranteeing a wipe if two teammates die separately before he is killed, and additionally does great damage to tankier T2 or Midrange teams.
Arms Dance debuffs the enemy defense and ev/ac, and then does 200BP phys damage to a single target as a chain, meaning if any hit does manage to miss, despite your innate 85% acc, you don't lose press turns.
Zealous Rebel, which is his teal Gacha skill, is the perfect skill for him, helping him fight against other Chi Yous, while giving him more HP.
Solid panels which give him damage, buff control, HP, and even more accuracy.
Has innate Force Repel, helping him fight against demons like Sabaoth and Nyarlathotep, along with Repel Fire in teal, letting him be a powerful demon against Elohim when paired with Demiurge or even Atavaka.
Combined with Shaddai, really punishes T1 teams that rely on crit passing and Elohim's high AoE damage.
Has incredible staying power with his innate repels and high damage reduction when in a state of Charge.
Does incredibly high amounts of damage in Phys Democ when paired with Zaou-Gongen and Futsunushi to get around his crit penalty.","Weak to Elec, a major weakness with Odin A's popularity.
Both Arms Dance and Omen of Rebellion hit 4x without preventing counters. Many players will use transfers like Faithful Counter, Zealous Rebel, and even Death Counter in a pinch to counter Chi You.

Has only fairly average stats. It's not always easy to make him do a ton of damage while also being able to survive long enough to proc his chains.
Not having Null Mortal neutered him versus Gozu-Tennoh, where most opponents have Silent Prayer, removing his Charge and any Tetraja effects, quickly removing him from the meta.

When combined with two other Lady or Femme demons (preferably her two other sisters), Passionate Allure charms all enemies at the end of the enemy team's turn. This forces teams to constantly waste turns curing Charm, while Passionate Rage constantly chips at them.
Has arguably the best Panels for ailment immunity. Panel 1 prevents the team from being swept by Alice A, while Panel 2 makes them immune to Charm in the events of a mirror match.
High Luck helps her with landing ailments and run a Dodge Tank build relatively well, especially if you have access to Epitome of Madness.","Passionate Allure's Auto-Charm can be punished by Daisoujou on the opposing team.

Due to the way the Moirai Sisters archetype is typically built, Revive Sealing units like Skull Knight are a very powerful counter.
Limited uses on healing, no Null Mortal, and the downfall of the Sisters archetype really limits her use in PVP in the Demeter meta.","As it is classified as a Recovery skill, the AI will spam Woven Fate to heal HP even if there are no downed demons, wasting the charges.

"Cthulhu","YP","YP","3","3","3","3","3","Disgustingly flexible, with Call of R'lyeh offering TWO Intimidating Stance turn removals if he goes second, reducing enemy MP if he goes first along with chip damage, gives him Null Mortal, inflicts Gloom on the opponent at the start of their every turn, and offers a 30% damage boost to enemies afflicted by Gloom
As if that weren't enough MP drain, Lost Sanity accurately describes the sanity of the devs at this point, being Megidolaon, an improved Mahamarin Karinon and Mahashibabooon, and a 2 MP removal all in one. Did I mention that instead of 8 mp cost like Megidolaon, it costs 5 mp at max level?
In theme with his kit, Suk Flexi offers different effects depending on whether or not he goes first, furthering his role as a midrange monster, and helping in the current meta where evasion can be king.
Panels increase his tankiness and almighty damage, while also offering additional buff control and Null Bind, so his chain effect to apply Gloom will always activate.
Has a great stat spread, with high Magic, Luck, Vitality, and middling Agi, which suits him perfectly as his kit doesn't care if he goes first or second.
Has innate Almighty Survivor for additional survivability and damage, because at this point what else does he need?
Oh, that's right, to match Nyarlathotep, he has four drain effects, giving him incredible anti-pierce capacity.","If he goes first, he won't have Gloom on the opponents without Nyarlathotep on your first turn, which is worth considering.
Suk Flexi is a skill name so terrible it gives Great Idea or the Slowda skills a run for their money.
He does suffer slightly from being a bit of an all rounder, in that he's too fast for a dedicated slow team, while not offering enough to run in a dedicated fast team, as even his mp drain in that case probably won't be enough to keep a T1 team alive if they fail to sweep.
Demeter paired with Maria will essentially make any amount of MP drain pointless. However, does better against Demeter teams that use Barong without Maria and can actually prevent Demeter from casting My Harvest!
Not particularly special in PvE where enemies have unlimited MP, and Charm and Bind are virtually impossible to land on high level enemies.","-"

Magna Mater provides a team-wide Fire damage boost, incredible for Democalypse.

Expensive multi-fusion that requires clear Asherah.","In PvP, Fire Pierce (weak) is insufficient due to the high prevelance of damage reduction through units like Demeter and Chi You.
Panel 4 specifically requires Trisagion or Maragidyne in order to trigger it, so stronger Fire transfers such as Fiery Soul Prison or Maragibarion won't work.

Additionally, when this chain procs, he will cast a one turn Sukunda and Rakunda effect. Additionally, as long as he is alive, his entire party will get +40% damage when hitting a crit, and 20% accuracy.
However, this passive does come with the cost of reducting his critical hit rate by 100%, meaning without might, it's not likely he'll crit.
Lethal Flood is a 200BP Physical Ice attack that pierces bulwark, and does an additional 70 BP chain on all enemies when the attack is successful. Additionally it ignores counters and Endure type effects. This combined with his might effects allows him to do a lot of bulwark piercing damage while also not using press turns, helping sweep a tanky team.
His panels aren't neccessary either, but a welcome bonus, adding more damage, accuracy, and additional buff control.
Top tier Ice Democ unit, with buff control and high ice damage, though against the boss with a 200% crit reduction, it's essentially impossible to get him to crit outside his first attack each turn.","He doesn't offer enough to his team to be useful in PVP. He's not exceptionally bulky or fast, nor does he have any game changing chain effects, making him a poor choice compared to the more powerful bulwark piercing units.

Very useful for Brands of Sin: Sloth auto-runs.","Is a hard support unit, relies on transfer skills to offer anything outside cleansing.
Soul Drain is a wasted slot, as it is MP expensive and doesn't add to Daisoujou's support build. It also wastes MP in auto, as the AI will cast it when no Ailments are currently active.
As he needs to constantly spam Cleansing Shout, P4, Divine Brands, or a Mana Aid transfer are mandatory for Sloth auto-farming, especially in Red.","When he has access to offensive spells (in Red or through transfers) his AI will prioritize those over Cleansing Shout if they can hit enemy weak points. This does not occur if your team is Binded and/or Charmed.
Comparatively, Daisoujou is better as a pure support demon (no weaknesses, provides buff control, can focus purely on survivability/evasion, more flexible on transfers), while Mahamayuri offers more offensive pressure and better Press Turn economy. Pick whoever your team needs more.
As of 2022, he's multi-fusible, but only Common Archetype (Clear) and at an approximate cost of 8 million mag per copy (3 million of that is unaffected by discounts), making it slow and expensive to fully Panel him."
"Dante☆","R","RP","3","2","2","4","2","Rapid Shot deals five hits and puts him in a state of Rebellion without consuming any MP. This can be useful versus MP Denial teams like Alice A.
High STR and VIT make him a bulky Phys Sweeper with with no weaknesses, perfect for slower Intimidating Stance Teams.
Million Stab is a piercing multihit AOE skill, useful for breaking Endures. At max levels it also refunds 2 MP on cast, making it easier to spam in PvE.","Low AGI and LUK affects his accuracy.
Missing just one of Rapid Shot's 5 hits results in lost Press Turns. The Rebellion Autocast will also not trigger if any shot misses.
Million Stab has high MP costs, making it difficult to use for PvP unless you pair him with Angra Mainyu.
No natural Pierce outside Panel 1 might cause issues when out of MP (Rapid Shot does not naturally Pierce).
His Awakening Skills are mostly useless.","Cannot be used in the same team as the regular 4★ Dante.
Limited-time Collaboration unit. Nobody knows if he will be rerun."
"David","P","P","3","2","2","1","1","He is essentially an entire Ailment Team neatly packaged into one demon. Not only does Bohemian-- err Bemusing Rhapsody remove Barriers, it also has a high chance of inflicting Charm and Curse, while only costing 5 MP to cast.
Deadly Melody autocasts two random buffs and debuffs every time ailments land, allowing you to repeatedly swing buffs in your favor especially when paired with other ailment demons like Lilith A and Angra Mainyu. This is very powerful with Panel 2 unlocked, as it gives your teammtes increased damage against Cursed and Charmed units.
Panel 3 reduces ailment cure rate by 25%. This is incredibly strong as it ensures Bind and Charm will always last a turn (as long as they don't have increased recovery).
Panels 1 and 3 give him increased Battle Speed, allowing him to act as a Speedster.
Innate Epitome of Madness and Insanity in Purple, combined with Bemusing Rhapsody's high ailment base chance means he is almost guaranteed to land his ailments, allowing you to forego ailment infliction for other brand stats like Speed instead.","Panels are mandatory on him, without them he is a rather mediocre ailment unit.
Stiff competition from Motoko Kusanagi who is also pretty much a standalone (heh) ailment package on her own. In a vacuum, Bind and Mute are arguably more useful ailments, and Motoko has the advantage of being fully useable without Panels.
Hard-countered by Ailment immunity, most notably Demeter, Maria, and Panel 2 Beelzebub☆.","While Bind and Mute might be more powerful on their own, Charm and Curse have more abuseable combos, most notably Lilith A, Alice A and to a lesser extent Panel 3 OG Lilith."
"Demeter","YP","TYP","5","5","5","1","1","Casts bulky Bulwarks very often - at the start of the battle, whenever any teammate other than herself takes damage, and whenever casting her unique skill My Harvest!. If Panel 2, she also Bulwarks at the start of the enemy's turn and debuffs the foe's ATK. This makes her team incredibly tanky.
My Harvest! Bulwarks the team and gives each of them 2 MP, offering both defensive and offensive pressure against the enemy. It also has Remnants, ensuring she uses up only half a press turn to cast it.
Whenever any teammate (other than herself) is attacked or takes fractional damage, she Bulwarks the team and casts a 1-turn Luster Candy. This heavily punishes AoE and random attacks, effectively undoing much of the damage dealt by the enemy. This is especially a problem for demons that are forced into automatic AoEs, such as Elohim or Vishnu A.
Elusis's Blessing makes any Bulwarked teammate immune to ailments and take -20% damage, making her team even more bulky. Panel 1 also doubles down on this for Demeter herself.
She's very difficult to take down due to the Bulwarks, damage reduction on top of that, and Null Mortal - but the foe will inevitably need to prioritize taking her down with Single-Target attacks. If paired with revivers such as Maria or Xi Wangmu, Demeter can be a menace. With an ally-downed punisher like Chi You, she can double as a landmine.
Yellow casts a 1-turn Defensive Cry to make it harder to take her down turn 1, while Purple gives her an endure.
Teal ups her Elec resistance to Null, so she won't be Weak to Elec until after the first hit of Zeus' Keraunos each turn.","Due to how duration ticks work, her Bulwarks will always go offline at the start of her team's turn, and won't go back online until she casts My Harvest. This makes her team susceptible to at start of enemy turn chain effects, as their HP bars are exposed and the ailment immunity isn't active.
If her team gets ailmented somehow, she doesn't have an innate way to cleanse them.
While she makes your team nearly unkillable in pve, it's worth noting if you want fast clears, her chains massively slow you down.","Regarding the effect where Demeter casts Bulwarks upon an ally being attacked:
This effect will still activate if the enemy's attack misses.
The Defense Support mechanic in PvP will also trigger this effect, letting Demeter's team tank through it for a while.
Oddly, Recarmdra does not trigger this effect, despite it effectively being 100% Fractional Damage to the user.
If the Luster Candy chain effect is activated during the enemy's turn (it usually will be), the buffs will wear off once her own team's turn starts.
Panel 2 Anahita casts Bulwarks at the start of her team's turn - this can close the window where Demeter's Bulwarks are offline. Alternatively, if the enemy has a start of enemy turn AoE that doesn't ailment (and doesn't hurt too much), that will restore Demeter's Bulwarks with the same timing."
"Demiurge","Any","RP","4","3","3","1","3","The only demon in the game with access to both Drain Pierce and Repel Pierce, Demiurge makes it incredibly easy to outfit your team with Anti-Pierce coverage, shutting down most elemental AOEs.
To add insult to injury (or in this case more injury to injury), False God triggers an Almighty AOE counter as powerful as Megidolaon upon a repel, which deals respectable damage thanks to his high MAG stat and boost to almighty damage. This makes him particularly useful versus demons like Atropos, Vishnu A, and Guan Yu who are rather forced into their AOE spells.
Supreme Creator provides a team-wide HP and MP heal upon a drain, which can be useful if run in bulky sustain teams. It also passively reduces the MP cost of all his skills by 1 MP, giving you more flexibility in brands.
Null Mortal in Purple makes him the only Anti-Pierce demon in the game who is immune to Mortal effects.
Red grants him access to discounted Ars Magna, a powerful single target Almighty attack.","Does nothing against Almighty and Fractional damage, both of which are extremely common in higher tiers of PvP.
Stiff competition from Atavaka, who not only has Repel Pierce but also the extremely useful Intimidating Stance passive in Purple.
Difficult to build optimally as he wants both damage and bulk/evasion; focusing on one will cause the other to suffer as a result.
Attribute affinity down completely shuts down his niche. He went from being high tier in pvp to nearly unused.","He can cast Invasion during the Democalypse Boss Phase, providing you a one-turn Offensive Cry. It only lasts one turn though, so he will need to repeatedly waste turns casting it, making it an average tech at best.
Has niche uses against Gozu-Tennoh with a Repel Phys or Drain Phys partner, helping prevent aoe mortal."

Desperate Hit deals Almighty (Physical) damage, which can currently be negated only by Lord of the Dead and Hawk of Light.
Iron Judgement deals Piercing Physical damage with a high chance to Bind, helping him land Desperate Hit shots. Low MP cost also makes it possible to be cast twice per turn even with War Brands.","Combination of ST, AOE, Phys and Almighty elements in his kit makes it difficult to further boost his damage.
Fairly mediocre stats.
Iron Judgement has unimpressive Base Power.
Does not have natural Pierce. This can cause issues with his AI attacking into Tetra Shift and/or Physical NDR when out of MP.","If you went first, Desperate Hit will trigger before opposing end of turn chain effects (like those from Nebiros and/or Hecate), giving you one last chance to clean up before they kick in.

"Echidna","P","TP","2","3","3","5","1","Freezing Gale deals Ice damage multiple times to all enemies. In addition to it being a pseudo Endure breaker, it also revive seals any enemy it downs, making her the first unconditional AOE Revive Sealer in the game.
Fecund Womb will randomly revive a dead ally with full HP at the end of an opponent's turn. It also gives her Null Bind, ensuring the skill will always pop off as long as she is alive.
Massive HP stats, combined with innate Epitome of Endurance and Null Mortal with Panel 1 make her very difficult to kill.
Butcher in purple helps to amplify her damage, while Teal gives her Repel Elec to cover her weakness.
Useful on stall teams made to encourage people to give up rather than fight, when combined with Demeter, Maria, and Xi Wangmu.","Weak to Elec unless Teal.
Difficult to build due to needing both bulk and damage.
Fecund Womb is limited to 3 charges.
Unlike most other revive seal attacks, Freezing Gale doesn't ignore endures upon a killing blow. Although this is somewhat offset by the fact that Freezing Gale hits each enemy demon four times, it can make killing demons with multiple endure skills quite difficult.
Panel 1 is very important due to it conferring her with Null Mortal. Without it, her survivability against enemy demons with mortal attacks is significantly reduced.
Not as cute as a certain Witch of Greed who shares her name.","-"
"Elizabeth","TP","TY","1","1","1","1","1","Innate ailment resistance in p1 helps her chain to cleanse the whole party as well as passively heal.
Lots of healing bonus along with decent magic stat means she's going to heal for a lot.
Ark is a cheap almighty single target attack that revive seals, letting her contribute both offensively and defensively to the party, and mostly avoid ndr.
Cleanses passively with Goddess Aid, meaning she doesn't take press turns from your bigger damage dealers.
Purple has Null Drk Zone-Dmg Panel, making Aura Gate exploration easy while taking up only one team slot.","Needs p1 to even remotely function, which is a tough ask of a collab unit.
Does not block charm, nor does she cleanse it, meaning to properly function as a cleanser, the entire team needs null charm, or she needs to use her transfers as Null Charm and Prayer, removing any build flexibility
Also does not block or cleanse curse, hurting her healing.
Healing is not strong in this game, meaning she's mediocre at a job that isn't too good to begin with.
Her damage simply isn't high enough with the escalating life totals in this game, and almighty damage is difficult to boost.
She's split between offense and defense and fails miserably at both. Daisoujou, a choice file unit, does her job far better, as does Mahamayuri, who has had reruns, while collab reruns are few and far between
Has almost no buff control for a support, with her only innate buff control being in p2.
Ark does not bypass endures, hurting its capacity as a revive seal.","Limited-time Collaboration unit. Nobody knows if she will be rerun."
"Elohim","P","YP","5","4","4","5","5","Solar Flare is a fire magic attack reminiscient of Dragon Blade, doing a strong ST hit and then an aoe follow up. However, both hits ignore endures, and this skill introduces the Remnants mechanic, meaning this skill will always only take half a press turn. No need to crit, no need to hit weakness, this skill will still take only half a press turn. Better yet, at P1 and max level, it costs 4 mp, making MP denial less effective as with Maria or divines, he will always be able to cast it.
Light of Elohim is just as loaded of a skill, offering him 35% magic damage, Fire Pierce, buff control every time he casts Solar Flare and at the start of battle, AND a free Maragidyne the first time his team kills a demon each turn, except this Maragidyne also ignores endures.
With the third highest magic and third highest agi in the game, along with innate Fire Accele and 40% battle speed from panels, he's fast, and hits hard, meaning you need to take fewer sacrifices to keep a high battle speed and still kill tanky teams.
Every single awaken skill is unique to Godly race demons, offering ST revive sealing almighty damage in red, immunity to mute charm and bind in yellow, 25% magic damage in purple, and drain light and dark in teal. Every single one of these skills has a situation where it's useful.
Has strong synergy with other demons with damaging chain effects, including even Atropos, where if she can kill a demon, he'll continue the carnage with Light of Elohim","He is fragile, so if the enemy gets to act, he will near certainly be going down. This is mitigated to a degree with Demeter.
His high agi and battle speed contribution can make him troubling to slot into teams other than turn 1 fast teams.
While far from slow, a good chunk of his battle speed comes from panels, meaning an unpaneled Elohim can be a speed liability compared to the highest tiers of players/whales.
Remnants can be stopped by attacking into a unit with a fire weakness while the opponent has Orcus.
The forced Fire AoEs will cause problems against Demeter teams, as it'll cause her to re-cast Bulwarks - in some cases undoing the damage you just dealt.","While he is incredibly powerful in PvE content, he will slow down your clears due to all of his chain effects.
He has the exact same agility as Astaroth. Make sure you watch your party setup to manipulate the turn order in the desired manner. Often Elohim into Astaroth is a useful order to make use of Elohim's guaranteed half press turn usage."
"Erlkonig","Any","YP","3","2","3","1","1","Alder King heals your team on your turn, and debuffs the enemy's attack on their's. When paired with P3, this turns into a full defensive buff swing in your favor.

Low AGI makes him perfect for bulky slow teams.","Weak to Fire. This is particularly bad in an Elohim-heavy meta.
Maziodyne is a wasted slot.
Not the best choice for Demeter stall teams because while he has nice healing and Null Mortal, he doesn't have powerful innate revive skills like Maria or Xi Wangmu, making him a subpar choice.","Due to Alder King's effect timing, it actually procs after most of the enemy's auto-skills have activated. When paired with demons that have similar timings (like Vairocana and Lachesis), it guarantees a full defensive buff swing regardless of what your opponent runs (Solar skills, Angra Mainyu's Panel 2, etc. all go off first, before getting wiped out)."
"Fariedone","TYP","Any","4","3","3","4","4","Hero of Prophecy grants Phys Pierce, puts his team into Zenith at the start of his team's turn, grants an ATK buff, and additionally grants 25% damage to physical skills and 30% acc to any allies in a state of Zenith. This massively buffs the power of any physical damage team.
Demonsbane also puts the team into a state of Zenith, and then chains a high damage aoe phys attack, all for 5 mp. Since the phys part is a chain effect, no press turns will be lost on miss or drain/repel, making it safe to use even against evasive enemies. Having two ways to grant Zenith really helps controlling statuses against enemies that use Gloom.
His awaken skills all have their own uses, depending on the situation.
Panels grant battle speed, buff control, and damage, along with a little bit of bulk, all things he needs to help his team sweep.
Good synergy with Hachiman, granting extra buffs to the team in Zenith.","180 agi and only 20% battle speed in panels is going to likely lower the battle speed of any fast team.
Demonsbane may be nice for not taking press turns on miss, but also will always take a full press turn as the phys is a chain effect, meaning you need to arrange turn order so he attacks on a half press turn. This also hurts his viability on democ prelim, where you need to transfer an aoe skill, rather than use Demonsbane.","-"
"Fafnir","T","T","1","3","3","1","1","Golden Greed automatically breaks Barriers and inflicts Poison on the enemy team at the start of their turn. This works regardless of whether Fafnir's team goes first.
This timing strikes during the short window where Demeter's Bulwarks (and thus her team's ailment immunity) may be offline.
With skill levels, Golden Greed increases Poison's damage from 5% HP fractional to 25% HP fractional, applying at the end of each demon's turn. This elevates Poison from a minor annoyance to a legitimate threat.
Panels 2 and 3 grant him 50% damage reduction from Poisoned enemies, making it difficult for the foe to kill him to disable Golden Greed.
Teal ups his Elec resistance to Repel, helping his bulk against Zeus teams.","Weak to Elec (unless Teal) and Ice.
No Phys Pierce until panel 3.
No boosts to attack damage in his kit, plus Blight's power being low, means his high STR is under-utilized.
Underwhelming if Poison does not land - neither the Poison damage pressure nor his vs-Poison bulk will apply in that case.
Ailments aren't helpful in lategame PvE, due to inflated enemy stats.","Since his main niche is chain effects before the enemy can act, you want to string together as many as possible:
P4 Nergal + Hachiman chains Poison into team-wide Might (Nergal) + Phys AoE (Nergal P4) + Zenith (Hachiman) + another Phys AoE (Hachiman) + team-wide Might again (Hachiman P2). This can apply a huge amount of damage pressure.
Fafnir + Kabuso + p3 Lilith creates a combo of Poison + Charm + Bind. If Kabuso is not available, Gurr can chain Bind from Poison.
To counter Demeter, Fafnir's team needs to go first, so that Demeter's start-of-battle Bulwark wears off when her team's turn comes up."
"Flauros","P","CP","2","1","1","5","4","With Panel 2 unlocked, Flauros absolutely wrecks Phys Democalypse Preliminary Phase, farming an absurd amount of multiplier due to the way his skills are coded (see Notes for more details).
Comboes well with Marici, as Iron Fist and Hell Leopard are considered different skills and will hence trigger Shimmer Arrow twice.
Can also be used in the Democalypse Boss Phase, as Hell Leopard will confer Tarukaja and Sukukaja to the team, allowing your other teammates to hit harder.","Weak to Ice unless Teal.
Does not gain true Phys Pierce unless fully panelled. This can cause issues with his innate Death Counter and/or when he runs out of MP. It also makes his Red Archetype less appealing as a result.
Low Base power on his skills means he will struggle to do damage.
P2 will consume the Rebellion buff granted by Hell Leopard. This ends up decreasing his damage, as the Rebellion buff is wasted on the 75BP chain instead of his 130BP (more if levelled) Iron Fist.
Due to each chain being a different skill, he procs tons of Demeter bulwarks, making him absolutely useless in the current pvp meta.","In Democalypse Preliminary Phase, you can only gain the +0.1 weakness hit multiplier once per skill, no matter how many times the skill hits. This is why you cannot gain more than +0.4 multiplier from skills like Ashura, Dragon Blade and MahaLantine. However, Flauros can repeatedly gain weakness hit multiplier, as Hell Leopard, Iron Fist and his Panel 2 chain effect are coded as different skills, bypassing the only once per skill limitation."
"Flauros Hallel","R","T","4","2","2","3","3","Demons die when they are killed by Baptisma, unable to be revived.
Unlike Skull Knight's Sword of Actuation and Lilith A's Temptation, Baptisma is a Spell instead of an Elemental Physical Skill. While it cannot crit as a result, it also cannot miss, giving Flauros Hallel the edge against evasive units.
Halo of Hallel gains boost levels as the fight drags on. At max level, it confers team-wide Lydia and Luster Candy, providing your team an incredible amount of sustain.","Repel Elec is no longer as useful as it used to be due to Zeus.
As nothing in his kit boosts damage, damage booster transfers are mandatory.
Requires a good team built around him to really shine.","As he does not gain Null Curse until he actually gets a turn, he can be killed by Angra Mainyu + Alice A combos if outsped.

"Frost Ace","P","P","3","2","2","2","5","Very good Ice Nuker with built-in Ice Boost and Master Assassin in Purple.
Vengeful Frost Fist is a heavy hitting Ice-element Physical attack that can Crit and autocasts Rebellion on hit. This allows him to crit infinitely at the cost of a measly 4 MP.

No Ice Pierce until panel 3.","Hee Ho"
"Futsunushi","Y","YP","4","2","2","5","4","Sword Deity's Might provides team-wide Rebellion every turn, massively increasing your team's physical damage. This is exceptionally powerful in Phys Democalypse, as scores there widely fluctuate depending on crits. It also increases the accuracy and damage of all allies in a state of Rebellion.
This has incredible synergy with Panel 3 Zaou-Gongen, getting the ball rolling on infinite Rebellion to grant the entire team Phys Pierce, while also helping ZG's accuracy.
Ryujin Reflection procs an AOE counter whenever your allies receive Physical damage, similar to how Asura shield functions in Battle Tower. It also casts Tarunda and Rakunda when it procs. This makes him a good check against faster, Physical-based teams like Astaroth and Hachiman. Also has some synergy with Hachiman as it will trigger his chains.
Yellow provides him Iai Isshin, a Physical AOE that puts him in a state of Charge if the attack is successful. This is very devastating for Phys Democalypse Prelim, similar to how Nero☆ racks up insane numbers in Elec Democalypse Prelim.
Red gives him access to Tempest Slash +, a souped up version of Tempest Slash that hits harder and ignores Endures. However, it is still a random-target attack, so it's only useful against lone targets.","Weak to Dark unless Teal.
No unique active means he is stuck using the generic Berserker God, which is underwhelming to say the least.
Middling AGI makes him awkward to fit in teams, and Asura Lord is an overall stronger Aura demon for T1 Physical Teams.
The AoE counter upon receiving a Phys attack can be exploited by Demeter teams to restore their Bulwarks - they just spam normal attacks on any party member.","The AoE counter upon receiving a Phys attack will still activate if the attack misses."
"Gabriel","RP","P","4","2","2","5","5","One of the core demons in the Archangels archetype. When combined with two other Herald or Divine demons, God's Word dishes out massive damage even before battle really begins. Since it is a Chain effect, it does not consume Press Turns even when hitting NDR.

Chain effects kill demons before they have a chance to talk, making her less useful for Aura Gate.

No innate Elec Pierce.
Chains can be a liability against Demeter.","The 10% weakness damage bonus from Elec Enhancement also applies to non-Elec skills like God's Word. This allows her to further punish any Hecate, Nebiros and/or Alice A who leaves Light Weakness open.

Supreme Might is our first multi-turn Intimidating Stance style skill, removing a press turn from the opponent up to three times per battle. If other demons remove two press turns on the first turn, this skill will still activate three times, removing press turns for up to four turns for the opponent. In addition, this skill grants Phys Pierce, casts a two turn Tetraja and Rakukaja on your team, and passively grants +30% damage dealt and +50% hit rate to allies that are immune to Mortal.
Mantra is the glue that pulls his kit together, being a 100 BP aoe that scales on his HP and ignores endures. This skill has up to 30 boost levels, and gains a boost level each time a skill that buffs stats for his team is used. After 10 boost levels, it inflicts mortal on all enemies if the skill is successful.
Solid awaken skills, though usually Prodigious Ability is the best call.
The lowest AGI in the game really helps him outslow other teams, and high LUK helps outweight the accuracy penalty of low AGI.
Even more bulk in panels, along with damage, much needed accuracy, and auto buffs if his team goes second, helping him rack up boost levels.","Low AGI makes it hard for him to hit evasive targets. Accuracy investment is a must, as if he misses a target, even the hit targets won't be hit by mortal.
His Tetraja can be removed, so he is vulnerable to mortal if it is removed by Silent Prayer, making him vulnerable in the mirror match.
Phys anti-pierce can be hard to work around, especially as his Red awaken, Crushing Force, doesn't have the mortal.
Loses a lot of value against enemies with innate Null Mortal, as they can't be comboed with Silent Prayer for a quick mortal kill.","Combos extremely well with Silent Prayer, consider Yellow Asherah as a budget teammate."

Hawk of Light refunds 3 MP and sets up Almighty Tetrakarn on kill, letting him spam Blade of the Absolute repeatedly while completely walling off demons like Shiva A. Additionally, at the start of the first turn it provides a 3 turn Zenith, additionally granting 25% Physical damage and 30% ailment infliction rate to any ally in a state of Zenith, including himself.
Has evasion thanks to innate Evade and Hawk of Light providing an Evasion bonus. Hawk of Light also additionally provides 20% Accuracy in levels.
Panel 2 provides him Null Charm, Null Bind, and Null Mute. Thanks to Hawk of Light's team-wide cleanse effect when he downs an enemy, he can function as an evasive cleric that can also help with DPS if a cleanser is not required. He also removes Tetrakarn from opponents when they enter that state with Panel 2.
His other panels add much needed damage boosters, more evasion, a big chunk of battle speed, and a charm multi target skill similar to Mother Harlot every time he enters a state of Might, solidifying a secondary role as a charmer.","As he does not have any damage booster in his kit outside of panels, damage transfers are mandatory if building him as an assassin.

P4 gives him Charge on an ally death, helping him make comebacks.","Low AGI stat means he will have accuracy issues. Dragon Blade's chain effect will not activate if it misses on the first target.
Only has ST skills unless in Red, which reduces his overall PvP usefulness.
Highly dependent on the first kill for tempo. Failing to secure the first kill will result in him not having enough MP for the next turn.
AoE chain after Dragon Blade makes it hard for him to avoid triggering Demeter, severely hurting any potential in PVP.","A Null Curse transfer makes him unkillable by Alice A, and also stops Curse from interfering with Loyal God of War healing."
"Guedhe","Y","YP","3","4","4","3","5","A unique evasion tank, with 65% evasion baked into his kit, and many benefits from evading attacks.
Hedonistic Reaper guarantees that if his team goes second, the opponents will end up in Gloom, because first the skill removes Zenith, then inflicts Gloom. Additionally, if anybody on his team dodges a Physical attack, he inflicts Gloom, a two turn Sukunda, and enemies in Gloom take 25% extra damage from Physical type attacks, deal 25% less damage with the same, and also have a 20% reduced hit rate and 30% reduced evasion rate, helping him dodge and also hit enemies. Additionally, this skill grants Dark Pierce.
Dark Gift is a Dark Physical attack with high 250 BP scaling off MATK, and a 100% crit rate, that also inflicts Gloom if it is successful.
Strong against units like Gozu-Tennoh, who tend to have trouble hitting evasive targets. By dodging Mantra, he can help counter sweep. Also helps counter Odin A's Zenith and Gloom combo, by removing his Zenith constantly.
Strong in Dark Democ, where Dark Gift can easily crit when combined with Glee brands, making him extremely powerful against the boss.
Powerful panels, with accuracy, evasion, damage, and a once a turn Charge if a party member dodges an attack, making his next Dark Gift hurt.","Lacks any innate HP boosters, and has only 147 VIT, meaning if he is hit, or hit by magic skills, he tends to melt quickly. He tends to be an all or nothing unit.
154 AGI is relatively high for a unit with Intimidating Stance but also low for an evasive unit, meaning even with his 65% innate, he could still be hit.
No Null Mortal means if he is hit, he will be hit by Mantra's mortal.
Suffers from the same problem every other evasion unit does: In order to invest enough in evasion to consistently dodge, he misses out on a lot of damage investment, meaning his skills won't be as threatening.
The minimum hit chance of 15% can come to bite you no matter how evasive you are.","Cool ass hat."
"Guts","P","P","4","3","3","5","2","Extremely high Crit rate thanks to innate Savage Glee and The Struggler. Butcher in Purple further augments his damage. Additionally, The Struggler grants Phys Pierce, 20% damage done with physical skills, 20% accuracy, and reduces mp cost of all Physical skills by 1.
Dragon Slayer does ramping aoe physical damage, starting at 130 and ramping up to 160, matching Gigantomachia's damage, but at 4MP and with added crit rate and a 2MP removal at boost 2. It also ignores all counter skills and at Boost 1, ignores Endures.
Is decently tanky thanks to good bulk and The Struggler providing him a better Enduring Soul that triggers 3 times.
Panel 1 gives him access to a Piercing Fire Physical AOE that does not cost MP, very useful against MP denial teams, and panel 4 makes a similar effect occur every time an enemy is downed, potentially chaining to sweep the enemy.
Other panels add more accuracy, damage, and HP, and cause Dragon Slayer to start at boost level 1.","Having no innate ST skills means he has trouble when a certain demon, such as Demeter, needs to be focused first. He also isn't the best at taking down bosses.
Average speed, bulk, and utility make it hard for him to fit into any team as the best slot.
His Panel 1 and 4 chains, along with Dragon Slayer's aoe nature hurt him against Demeter, limiting his PVP use.","Cannot be used in the same team as Berserker Guts.
Limited-time Collaboration unit. Nobody knows if he will be rerun."
"Hachiman","RP","YP","5","4","4","5","4","Automatically casts Zenith and ATK + EV/AC buffs on his team's first turn.
When he uses Berserker God or Vorpal Blade, or when a teammate uses any physical attack (miss/crit capable, not just Phys element), he automatically casts Zenith and a 50% crit Phys AoE.
This also works on the standard attack that all demons have, so MP draining can't stop Hachiman's team from activating this chain effect. It won't work for demons that overwrite their standard attack with magic though, such as Panel 2 Surt A.
-1 MP cost to all Phys skills and Vorpal Blade in Red means he can cast Berserker God or Vorpal Blade for 5 MP each - allowing for casting either of them turn 1 in PvP with War Brands. He shouldn't have MP issues.
Enables powerful T0 comps that go before Demeter's bulwark activates if comboed with abilities like Tiamat A's chains. These can be a counter-meta team. Jack the Ripper and Sraosha can be budget options.
If Panel 2, grants team-wide Might whenever he enters Zenith, once per turn. This combined with his automatic Zenith on the first turn, and whenever he attacks, and whenever a teammate attacks, makes him similar to Panel 3 Zaou-Gongen but with built-in Auto-Rebellion and infinite Zenith.
He can rack up incredible amounts of damage in Democalypse Prelim, due to the AoE chain effect and team-wide Might. This is to a point where Hachiman + some Phys demons can dominate Prelims of any element, not just Phys.","Weak to Force unless Teal.
No unique attack skill - he's stuck with Berserker God. Transferring a better one doesn't really work, as he can only proc Jingu's Divine Light with specifically Berserker God or Vorpal Blade.
The buffs he casts on the first turn last for only 1 turn, and he lacks any other way of casting buffs.
His forced chain effect AoEs can be a problem against anti-pierce, as well as AoE punishers such as Demeter. He needs to be built very strong in order to pierce her Bulwarks, but it is possible.","Has an interesting synergy with Jack the Ripper, allowing him to potentially sweep squishier teams before anybody even has a turn, especially when paired with a well built Sraosha."

Additionaly at the end of his turn does a 100 BP Physical attack on a random target that also inflicts mortal, revive seals, and ignores counters and Endure.
Sword of Fealty is a 200 BP Phys skill with 100% crit rate, that places the team in a state of Might and gives a 1 turn Tarukaja and Sukukaja effect.
Has Phys Accele innately which is nice for fast teams, and Intimidating Stance in purple, giving him use in every speed.
Panels offer more speed, teamwide accuracy, damage, and buff control when gloom activates.","While Phys Affinity Reduction seems scary, at the moment he is hard to slot into teams without causing issues.
His personal damage isn't the highest, meaning he needs powerhouse teammates to make up for it.
Is heavily countered by Shaddai, because his teammates will near certainly be critting because of his teamwide state of Might, meaning Shaddai will limit your press turn generation.","There are a few Hagen Berserker Guts teams in high level PvP that abuse his Phys support to do massive damage, wiping even tanky teams."

Virtually immune to ailments thanks to Null Bind and Lunar Awakening. Transferring a cleanse skill like Prayer or Silent Prayer will allow her to function as a cleric, while still maintaining her offensive presence.
Panel 2 lets her run Life or Spell brands without worrying about MP.","Not very bulky due to middling VIT and HP stats.
Weak to Light (unless Teal) and by extension the Archangels matchups.
As Lunar Awakening only cleanses at the end of the enemy's turn, she can still be killed by Alice A if she is cursed in the same turn (such as through Mahaju).","Innate Repel Dark means she can't be sniped by Alice if paired with Alilat or Atavaka. This is very significant as most dedicated ailment teams run Alice to remove the cleric.
Lunar Awakening only triggers at the end of the enemy's turn. This makes her useless for Brands of Sin Sloth 11, as the ailments trigger at the beginning of the turn."
"Heimdall","Y","YP","3","2","2","2","2","Bifrost Keeper boost his bulk up to 50% hp, and at the start of the first two enemy turns, gives him a 2500 hp Bulwark, and increases his teams defense, making him and his entire team harder to kill. Additionally, on the start of his own turn, he raises the attack of his team, helping his team counter sweep.
Stout Horn is a versatile attack, doing a high amount of ST almighty damage, and adding a bulwark to his whole team when his hp is above 80%, or doing fractional damage based on max hp to the whole enemy team when his hp is below 80%.
Intimidating Stance in purple works well with his low agi of 102, and Lunar Downfall works as well if both stances are covered, say by a demon like Cthulhu
Panels include Null Bind to help him do his chain effects, an almighty damage boost, and a large amount of additional HP.","No Null Mortal leaving him vulnerable to demons that have mortal attacks.
Focuses mostly on tankiness for himself, meaning his team might be vulnerable to being swept. Additionally, even if he is the sole survivor against a fast sweeping team, it's unlikely he can counter sweep with his skill set.
With no ability to hit weakness or crit, his almighty skills are liable to use a full press turn, hurting your press turn economy.
While the chain with Stout Horn is good with Demeter, the chain on Heroic Horn is if anything, a liability, giving him poor placement in the current meta.","-"

If hit by a physical attack (miss/crit capable, not just Phys element), he retaliates by casting Gloom and a Fire AoE on the enemy team. If panel 1, he also debuffs their DEF.
Scarlet Chop is a strong Fire ST attack that hits two separate times with 80% crit rate each. This combined with +20% from innate Epitome of Finesse means he effectively has 100% crit rate.
Low AGI but 65% accuracy boost from skills and panels means he can fit well into slow teams, while still being able to hit decently often. Intimidating Stance in Purple synergizes well with this.
Works well in fire Democalypse with Rending Fire innate and Hinokagutsuchi (Skill) giving extra damage in boss, or extra ratio in prelim.","Weak to Ice and Dark.
Will have accuracy issues if not Panel 2, since 50% of his 65% accuracy boost is in there.
Questionable in PvP, since he has major problems when against Zeus or Demeter:
Attribute affinity down level 2, combined with Hino not having any NDR (aside from Teal's Null Phys), means he will become Weak to that element - nullifying his 60% damage reduction.
The retaliatory AoE can be exploited by Demeter teams to recover their Bulwarks - they can just spam normal attacks on him to recharge bulwarks to full.","-"

Decent MAG with innate Ice Boost lets him fire off strong Bufudynes.","No Ice Pierce.
Does not have Speedster innately which in turn consumes a skill slot.
Weak to Phys and Fire, both very bad ones in the current meta. Phys Weakness is particularly terrible unless paired with Orcus for Press Turn denial.
North Wind chains are just not damaging enough to be anything more than a liability against Demeter. His only role in PVP is currently being a speed trap for fast teams without Demeter which are few and far between.","Red gets Mazandyne and panel 1 has -50% Ice/Force damage received, so he is helpful for Force Alter-World.

Yinglong Killer has a very high MP cost and cannot be fired off Turn 1.
Below average HP and VIT stats.
His panels focus on a bizarre healing role which in theory could be useful doing damage and healing, but he doesn't really have the bulk to survive PVE nukes.","Only gains 30% acc in P4, not 100%. Intern error!
More or less outclassed by Guts. Oh how the mighty have fallen!

Trivializes Brands of Sin Stages 10, opening up brand farming on Auto.
If Panel 4, any team member in a state of magic repel takes 20% less magic damage (Almighty is reduced by another 15%) and deals 20% more magic damage.

Huang Long Gaming","Pierce bypasses Five Elements.
Five Elements can be removed through Makara Break, most notably by P3 Samael.
When Five Elements blocks an attack, it's broken - meaning only the first attack is blocked, so if the enemy has a chance to attack again in the same turn, that attack will pass.
Very MP hungry, needs Divine Brands or Mana Aid to function well.","Yellow AI has issues on auto as it will sometimes cast Luster Candy when you want to be spamming Five Elements instead. Due to this, Yellow is mostly recommended for Manual Play, and Purple for Auto-ing.

Just a really underwhelming demon at a point where kits need to be overloaded to be powerful.

Panels past 1 do nothing for her Democalypse builds (and even then, panel 1 only helps Prelim). However, this also means she doesn't need a lot of investment to reach her full potential for Democ. This combined with 4+4 fusion paths means it's easy to build multiple Ishtars for different Democ elements as needed.
Despite her AoE potential from panel 1 for Prelim, it's more important to have her manually-buff for Boss. Only consider her for Prelim if Boss's buffing is already handled by someone else.

Of note, he innately has Drain Phys, making him cheese PvE content like nobody's business, and gives Gozu-Tennoh trouble, while also working well with him to prevent another Gozu-Tennoh from mortaling him.
Ratnamaru is a 240 BP Phys ATK scaling Almighty skill with remnants, that also casts a 1 turn Luster Candy, heals 30% of the hp of all party members, and three times, combined with Eternal Order, will revive a party memeber with a 50% HP Bulwark. This allows him to consolidate the role of Drain and Repel Pierce, Healing, Reviving, Battle Speed, Press Turn control, and some damage, all into one demon.
Silent Prayer discounted in Yellow helps him set up for Gozu-Tennoh sweeps, and Almighty Accele increases his damage and battle speed, helping hit speed targets.
With a Null Charm transfer, in Yellow he can work as a cleanser for ailments.
Works well in almost every kind of team. He has powerful synergy with Gozu in T2 teams, offers immense utility in Midrange teams, and damage, speed, and the unique ability to tank attacks like Mantra in T1 teams, allowing him to potentially let a T1 team survive past their first turn to clean up stragglers, especially when combined with Demeter.
Useful but not necessary panels, offering himself a turn 1 Bulwark, offensive buff control, and more damage, HP, and speed.","No Null Mortal which might not be a problem with Mantra, but leaves him open to abilities like Death Flyers.
For a demon that has 70% HP built into his kit, 152 VIT isn't particularly high, meaning if you want him to survive, you still need to stack quite a bit of HP on him.

This means as long as anybody on your team is healing, Kangiten will chain massive BP almighty attacks, while also supporting the party. He also has good bulk in order to stay alive to keep chaining.
Any time an enemy or ally dies, Kangiten will do an 80 BP team heal, which starts more chains of almighty attacks.

High base AGI and increased Battle Speed from Panel 2 make him invaluable for fast teams. Transfer Speedster if you need even more zoom!
Force Anti-Pierce is very rare in the current meta, allowing him to sweep with impunity. Even on the rare occasion you do encounter Force Anti-Pierce, you can simply cast Soaring Blades on another demon that does not Drain/Repel it - even if the chain AOE is Anti-Pierced, it won't consume Press Turns due to it being a chain effect.

Dragon of Hesperia also provides him Null Mortal, and innate Null Bind means his passives cannot easily be stopped.
Fury Raid casts Rakunda and Sukunda before chaining into a piercing physical AOE sweep. Because the AOE is a chain effect, you will not lose Press Turns even if it misses and/or hits into Phys NDR+Anti-Pierce, allowing him to spam it without concern.
Purple gains Intimidating Stance, whereas Teal gains Drain Phys for pairing with Demiurge.","Weak to Ice.
Doesn't do much damage due to lack of damage boosters in his kit.
Due to Demeter punishing lightly damaging chain effects, and preventing ailments, Ladon heavily suffers in the current meta.","-"

Weak to Force unless Teal.
Lack of good innate offensive skills wastes her high MAG stat.
Countered very hard by Daisoujou, who clears her charms and punishes her for using them.
Very bad bulk.
Panel 4 requires Charm to hit, which is unlikely in both PVE and PVP, meaning it's not a very useful panel.

"Lakshmi A","Y","RP","4","4","4","1","5","Diwali restores MP to the whole team upon receiving any healing from skills, and fires off a 220 BP Light chain, as well as gives the team a one turn Tetraja. This has incredible synergy with Mithras, who will do his own chains because of the light attack, or start the chain with his healing after another unit uses a light attack.
One of the best healers thanks to innate Recovery Amp and Virtuous perity, which also cases Barrier, and an Almighty repelling Makarakarn as it gets boost levels, making it a potent skill for topping off your team, starting Diwali chains, and potentially protecting your team as well.
Her panels give her exactly what she needs, with P1 giving damage, evasion and resistance to light damage, P2 giving healing effectiveness and making her team take less damage under Tetraja, P3 giving defensive buff control and HP, and P4 giving even more HP, light damage, and a 30% damage booster to her whole team's magic damage while under a Makarakarn effect.
Strong synergy with Vivian, who will allow her to do T0 chains, potentially sweeping teams before anything can happen.","While she does a ton of damage through sheer number of chain effects, she has very few boosters for damage in her kit before P4. She also has relatively low VIT so you have to choose between bulk or damage to a degree.
Needs specific team comps to be successful, and they tend to be all or nothing. If your team cannot win on the first turn, you will not survive to a second turn in most situations.","In Yellow, AI prioritizes Defensive Cry which does not trigger Diwali.

"Lanling Wang","Any","YP","4","2","2","3","5","Is the first demon to come with a counter to Gloom, called Zenith, granting his team accuracy, evasion, crit rate, ailment infliction, crit resist, and ailment resist through the status. Additionally, when your team is in a state of Zenith, he gives the entire party Phys Amp and 30% crit rate, making him exceptional for fast physical teams
Flying High hits like a truck, doing 200 bp with 50% crit rate for 5mp, or 4mp with p2, while ignoring endures, and when he hits, sends his team into Zenith. It hits so hard, especially charged in Zenith, that even with brands that make you choose between accuracy and damage, you can get some extra accuracy and still do tons of damage.
Once per turn, Mask of Veiled Beauty will give him charge when an opponent is downed. If he's in charge from a previous turn, he can kill something with a charged Flying High and still go into charge, enabling massive damage over multiple turns.
Is fast with 232 agi, along with 20% innate battle speed, 20% more from panels, and 20% more from Phys Accele in purple.
Good panels in general, providing innate mp reduction to Flying High, innate Phys Prana, and battle speed and damage.","His AI is garbage and will not Flying High three times in a row, regardless of MP. This means if he could get 3 in a turn due to press turn generation, he still won't use it, even though the third would be under a state of Zenith against Gloom.
Turn order is complicated because you want him to go after units like Astaroth and Hero Masakado, who can end up killing units and using skills to swing buffs, also leading to him getting charge, but on the other hand, you want Lanling early in turn order to provide Zenith to the rest of your team.
Doesn't actually put your team into Zenith until after his second Flying High versus Gloom.
Is essentially exclusively single target, because if you aren't using Flying High, you miss his gimmick of Zenith, and the massive buffs he provides, making him less useful.
If you miss on a fast phys team, you're as good as done, and his early actions in a turn could still potentially be under Gloom, making missing a real potential.
Needing a kill to get Charge is challenging in the current meta.","-"

"Lilith A","P","P","3","1","1","3","3","Demons die when they are killed by Temptation, unable to be revived.
Temptation can be fired off Turn 1 due to its low MP cost (5 MP), even against Alice A by using Divine Brands. It will also apply an AOE Charm if the attack is successful, which synergizes well with her passive.
In addition to granting her Dark Pierce, Forbidden Fruit fires off another Temptation at the end of the turn if anyone is charmed. This lets her break Endures and/or clean up any remaining units.
Panel 2 grants her a whopping +50% Crit Chance, which helps to boost her damage.
With Glee Brands and Panels, she can crit against the Dark Democalypse boss.","Weak to Light unless Teal.
Requires a good team setup around her to truly shine, as Temptation has relatively low BP and no increased crit rate. Even with Dark Amp in Purple, she will have damage issues unless you grant her Auto-Rebellion and ensure buffs are in her favor (for example via Kuyo Flash).
The Democalypse boss has 100% crit resist, meaning even with her high crit rate she'll need Panels and Glee Brands to make a crit happen consistently.
Relatively frail, requires Panels and/or Life Brands to survive in PvP, Passionate Rage in particular.
If she does manage to get her chain against a Demeter team, it still won't do enough damage to actually do anything other than swing buffs in her favor and create a Bulwark.","Red gives her access to discounted Mamudodyne, useful if you want a piercing AOE.

Cannot be used in the same team as Lilith."
"Longinus","RP","P","4","3","3","3","5","Bulky, with 202 Vit, 70% innate HP, and attacks that scale based on Phys DEF, allowing him to build a defensive stat and still deal damage.
Centurion grants an extra press turn once per turn when Holy Lance of Longinus is used, even when the skill is NDR'd, and also acts as Intimidating Stance when his team goes second. Additionally, any time he receives damage, he casts two random buffs on the party, giving him good defensive utility.
Holy Lance of Longinus pulls together the kit, being a 250BP Physical skill that picks between Phys and Light damage, with a high 80% crit rate, scaling on Phys DEF. This allows him to take his defensive utility and still do damage. On top of the high damage this skill can do, it also removes good statuses, and ignores counters and endures. This is a loaded skill that can be useful against demons like Gozu-Tennoh, who grants his entire team Tetraja.
Phys DEF is easier to raise than ATK stats, helping him reach higher damage numbers.
Innate 65% acc in his kit in Purple, and 35% otherwise helps him hit evasive targets.
Incredible for democ boss on both phys and light, offering a press turn while doing substantial damage.
Impressive panels that offer Null Mortal, flat Phys and Mag DEF, even more accuracy, Physical damage reduction for the whole team, and Phys/Light damage.","P1 is nearly mandatory for the Null Mortal.
No damage boosters in his kit aside from P3, meaning he might not hit as hard as you expect from a 250 BP skill.
Offers very little in terms of magic damage reduction, so while he can tank physical damage well, things like Botis are still extremely threatening to him.
His AI will attack into Kalki NDR, costing his team press turns. This is a massive liability when used on defense teams.
Feels like a sidegrade at best to other defensive options in many cases.","He is essentially immune to the AI not being able to use the same skill more than 3x in a row feature, because the Phys and Light versions of his skill are counted as different skills.
If his random buffs are activated during the enemy turn (they usually will be), those buffs will wear off once his own team's turn starts."
"Lucifer","P","P","3","3","3","5","5","Morning Star is the most powerful Almighty AOE spell in the game, with 170 BP and Bulwark Pierce. Combined with Butcher in Purple, this allows him to deal massive amounts of damage.

P2 gives him a large amount of bulk and once per battle, a 50% heal and 50% bulwark at the end of his turn. P3 offers 25% more almighty and fire damage, and grants Lucifer a Concentrate effect once per turn when he downs a demon, giving massive damage potential.
Fast-Debilitate from Panel 4 is incredibly useful in both phases of Democalypse.","Weak to Light unless Teal.
Very MP hungry, requires teammates like Demeter and Maria to help with MP Management.
While his buffs may at a glance seem enticing, he still struggles with the prevelance of MP drain the meta, and while Morning Star is strong, with no endure pierce it's hard for him to get the first kill to get his concentrate, let alone cast the skill a second time.

"Lugh","P","P","5","3","3","4","5","Innate Wretched Blow is extremely rare, making him hit weaknesses hard.
Samildanach is a role defining, granting ailment immunity, partywide 30% damage boost when hitting weak points, and reducing enemy force and light affinity by 1 level at the start of his turn.
Additionally it does a Light Physical 60 BP chain that casts a one turn Tarunda and Sukunda if it's successful. When any demon in the party hits a weak point, Lugh also enters a state of charge once per turn.
Tathlum Strike finishes off his kit, with a 200 BP ST Physical Force attack with 100% crit rate that also reduces the Force affinity of that enemy by 1 level. Additionally it clears any ailments for the rest of the party.
His kit is hand crafted to be used in BoS Sloth 14. From ailment cleansing to Light and Force support, along with his bulwark pierce, he's a demon made to clear that stage.
P1 reduces the cost of his active by 1 which is always useful, and the rest of his panels help with speed, damage and accuracy, making them effective but not necessary for his role of clearing BoS Sloth 14.","His start of turn physical chain occurs after the enemy Demeter would have created her first bulwark, making him not work as a T0 Hachiman chain starter, severely limiting his PvP use.
Has stiff competition in PvE from Okuninushi, who is much faster than him and also offers similar ailment cleansing effect. While he is better at doing more damage and supporting his team's damage, and clearly outclasses him in Sloth 14, Okuninushi does offer much more battle speed which can be useful in other situations. Additionally, Demeter often can handle all ailment issues in PvE on her own, while offering much more party support.

A solid set of panels that give him more hp, damage reduction, fire damage, and gives him Dionysus's passive, with a 50% chance to charm anybody who strikes him with a physical attack.
Intimidating Stance in purple synergizes great with his skill set and his low agi.
A kit hand crafted to disable fast turn 1 physical attacker teams.
A solid stat spread with high luck, vit, and mag, while also having only 93 agi.","What is arguably his signature trait in charming attackers is locked behind Panel 2.
His strengths are pretty one sided. While he is exceptional against fast teams, he struggles against slower teams and doesn't provide much value.
While devastating against a single opponent, besides the first hit, the secondary hits of Scarlet Inferno will only tickle, especially against a bulky set of opponents.
Has no way to remove barriers, and also is vulnerable to mortal.
Vulnerable to fire anti-pierce because you can't control the secondary hits of Scarlet Inferno
He can become near invulnerable to Phys damage when combined with Demeter and Beelzebub (Human) but he still offers nothing other than being hard to kill.","He only reduces Fire and Phys damage, so it's important to keep that in mind when you're facing other damage sources."

Wrathful Flame reduces defense, allowing your teammates to hit harder.

Goes through Endure as Wrathful Flame is three separate hits.","Combination of ST and AOE in his kit makes it difficult to further boost his damage.","Unlike Indrajit, lack of MP recovery means he cannot spam Wrathful Flame as easily in PvP.

Hits fairly hard due to innate Force Amp, high BP on Blossoming Cyclone and a good MAG stat. As a bonus, it also heals your whole party, allowing him to provide sustain the same way Ardha does.
Possesses the extremely coveted Repel Force, which makes him a great pair for Repel Pierce units such as Demiurge (for comparison, the only other generalist Repel Force demons are Mot and Mastema, as Raphael and Pale Rider only work in specific compositions).
Teal can be used to patch up his Elec Weakness, while Master Assassin in Purple lets him hit harder.","Weak to Elec (unless Teal).
Difficult to build optimally as he wants both damage and bulk/evasion; focusing on one will cause the other to suffer as a result.
Offers almost nothing to a team when Demeter and Maria already exist. Completely powercrept out of PVP.","Comparatively, Daisoujou is better as a pure support demon (no weaknesses, provides buff control, can focus purely on survivability/evasion, more flexible on transfers), while Mahamayuri offers more offensive pressure and better Press Turn economy.

Panel 4 grants auto-charge upon Mara's first turn, ensuring he is immediately up and running.
Meme","Ice Weakness and non-existent bulk makes him go limp at the sight of Ice skills.
Expensive to fuse, will quickly blow through your Magnetite reserves. (only 5+5 fusion paths are available)
Requires damage boost transfers to supplement his damage.
Middling AGI means he will have accuracy issues and occasionally miss the hole. Also doesn't slot into Intimidating Stance teams well as a result.
Due to Mara having no single-target attack besides his regular thrust, Anti-Pierce units like Rama, Alilat and Atavaka are a turn off.","A staple of Phys PvE teams with Zaou-Gongen to pound through waves and bosses (such as in AG2 Boss Rush and Hells Park 91-99), as Auto-Charge is an incredibly powerful effect."

Is immune to ailments and has Salvation built into her kit to cleanse for her party, with a large mp reduction and charge increase in p1
Swings defensive buffs in her teams favor every turn with p2.
In addition to making her team near impossible to kill, she also gives her entire team Infinite Chakra, allowing them to use their skills much more freely.
If anybody on her team gets killed, then at the end of the enemy's turn, she will revive her entire team once per game. She additionally has more revives through a skill in yellow.
Is so absurdly powerful that she can fit in any team from slow teams to a mana battery in fast teams, and anything in between.","While still amazing without them, her power really spikes with P1 and P2
If she is revive sealed, Xi Wangmu will not revive her even though she removes the revive seal due to how the game is coded, with on self death triggers activating after ally death triggers
Has no innate evasion so you really need cracked brands to get her evasion high.

"Marici","P","P","2","2","2","1","1","Shimmer Arrow lets her follow up ANY physical skill with a piercing Light ST nuke. This is great for cleaning up Endures and spreading out chip damage.
Daylight Blade deals Piercing Phys damage while putting her into a state of Concentrate, allowing her chained Shimmer Arrow to hit much harder. This effectively gives her a 300 Base Power ST nuke (360 if it crits!) that also ignores Endures.
Incredible synergy with Sraosha, as Shimmer Arrow will proc off his Soul Judgement chain, letting you snowball kills with multiple chain effects.
Works great in Brands of Sin Sloth 10-12 where a majority of the enemies are weak to light.","Unimpressive STR stats, low base power on both her skills and no damage boosters in her kit severely hurt her damage output.
Difficult to boost her damage due to her being a dual Physical and Light Hybrid attacker.
Does not have natural Pierce. This can cause issues with his AI attacking into Tetra Shift and/or Physical NDR when out of MP.
Shimmer Arrow is nowhere near strong enough in PVP to do anything other than trigger additional Demeter bulwarks.","For manual play, Shimmer Arrow will hit whoever your cursor is on. On Auto and/or Defense however, you are at the mercy of the AI for who she snipes.

This press turn generation plus innate Butcher makes him valuable for Democalypse Prelim.
Kuyo Flash does a 160 BP Almighty attack scaling on PATK, that does a full Luster Candy and Debilitate swing for one turn.
His panels offer great Democalypse support, with him granting up to 35% party damage to aoe attacks while under Tetraja.
P3 reduces his MP costs, and grants his team another Tarukaja and Sukukaja effect along with 2 more MP the first time a teammate downs a demon each turn, and P4 gives him an improved Great Idea, granting him 30 to each stat, and 30% battle speed.
This MP granting effect gives him potential in PvP as an MP battery and PT gen all in one.","No good physical attacks to exploit his innate Phys Pierce. Only Phys attack available to him is Myriad Arrows in Red, which has random targeting and is thus not very reliable.
Easily countered by outspeeding. This is a problem for last hour PvP, as Masakado A defenses will get relentlessly targetted by players looking to climb last minute.
Kuyo Flash would almost be better if it didn't do damage, as it doesn't hit hard enough to pierce through Demeter's bulwarks, and then she chains her own Luster Candy negating half of the buff control.
His buffs don't do enough to bring him back into massive PvP relevance.","Cannot be used in the same team as Masakado.
None of his Awaken skills are particularly useful for him. Enduring Soul is his best one but it won't be that useful considering that he's built for a fast team where the only thing that matters is high offensive power and high accuracy for Phys attackers. Myriad Arrows could be useful to take advantage of his innate Pierce, but as just said it isn't a good Phys spell.
If building for Democalypse Prelim, try to transfer a Rending <element> skill to make use of his PATK. However, these skills are event-locked and may be hard to obtain. If none are available, an AoE magic skill is fine.

Mark of the Beast deals fixed damage and mutes all enemies at the end of his team's turn. Fixed damage goes through the Main Character's shield in Battle Tower, allowing you to deal full damage even if his allies are still alive.
P2 gives him Auto-Barrier Break if going first, turning him into a standalone ailment package similar to Motoko Kusanagi (except less visually appealing). This can be useful with Tiamat A if you really need a barrier break.","Panel 2 is mandatory for the Auto-Barrier Break. He is just another mediocre ailment demon otherwise.

Innate Null Charm, Null Bind in Purple and Illusionary World makes her virtually immune to skill-restricting ailments. Transferring a cleanse skill like Prayer will allow her to serve as the team's Cleric, while still being able to deal chip damage thanks to Glamorous Allure.
High Luck and huge amount of built-in Ailment Infliction help her land Charm from Glamorous Allure reliably.","Fairly mediocre MAG and unimpressive Base Power on both skills hurt her damage potential.

Super tanky with high VIT and 70% HP boost from skills and panels.
Low AGI but 50% accuracy boost from skills and panels means he can fit well into slow teams, while still being able to hit decently often.
Automatically revives a random teammate when one dies (once per battle), and gives them a massive Bulwark. If panel 2, it's raised to a full Bulwark, and also gives smaller Bulwarks to the rest of the team. This can add considerable bulk to your #1 threat, which is presumably who the enemy will try to kill first. This effect can also revive Melchi himself if he dies, so attacking him first doesn't solve the issue.
Mighty Blow deals Almighty Physical ST damage with a 50% crit rate and counter-ignoring, followed by a 10-hits random-target attack with the same traits. This combined with his high LUK means he should crit often, and the many hits of the chain effect could break endures. Repel Almighty Physical is also quite rare, and even if it did show up, the multiple small hits will just break it with little penalty - so he usually won't be blocked out of dealing damage with this skill.","Weak to Force unless Teal.
Lacks Null Mortal, potentially making his high bulk irrelevant.
If the enemy takes out 2 or 3 allies in one skill cast, they likely took out your #1 threat and whoever was next to them. The random targeting of Melchi's revive might revive the less-threatening one.
Can't cast Bulwarks until somebody dies first, and can't re-cast Bulwarks after the ones from the chain effect wear off.
Shut down by Revive Ban - not only can he not revive anyone, he can't Bulwark anyone either.
Mighty Blow's random-targeting chain effect can be inconsistent if most of the enemies are still alive. It also has problems against Demeter teams, where hitting an enemy other than Demeter means she'll re-Bulwark her whole team.","The damage boosters in his kit only apply to Almighty, so Red's Gigantomachia only gets the accuracy boosts."

Trillion Dark's chain effect adds even more damage to his hard hitting attacks and also can be used to help chip down evasive targets safely, without risking press turns.
Every color has a niche, allowing flexibility in team building.","No innate buff control other than Auto-Taruka in yellow and Rakunda in p2 means he needs either transfers or his team to cover buff control, and transfer slots are highly contested in fast teams
No innate speed boosters without panels, along with his agi not being THAT high means he slows your team down.

Works well in an Archangels Team, as Fire of Sinai is great for cleaning up and breaking Endures (especially with Panel 4) and can be cast T1 thanks to Infinite Chakra and Panel 1.
Gains discounted Mahamadyne in Red, which is great for Brands of Sin Sloth 10 and 11 farming.
Panel 3 amplifies all Magic damage.","Very difficult to fuse, only 1 recipe available (Barong + Vishnu). This is particularly bad as he has four panels to work on instead of the regular three.
No damage boosters until panel 3.
Only random target skills is a great disadvantage in PvP. Mahamadyne in Red does not really resolve the problem.
Full Almighty / non-Piercing kit means he is shut down hard by Five Elements.
Low AGI stat penalizes him in Archangels teams.
Panel 4 makes him even worse against Demeter as it will trigger her bulwark a second time.","Still needs some kind of MP sustain (and possibly Panel 1) to cast Fire of Sinai T1 when facing Alice A.
The bonus hits provided by Panel 4 are coded as a different skill from Fire of Sinai and will not inherit effects such as Concentrate."
"Michael","TYR","TR","3","2","2","2","5","Soul Judgement deals massive damage against single targets, ideal for Bosses and Democalypse.
While he has pretty mediocre MAG stats, Panels 1 and 3 help to offset this by providing him a whopping +40% to Light damage.
Panel 2 and 4 increase his Battle Speed, allowing him to act as the team's Speedster particularly for Archangels.
Panel 4 confers Light Pierce to all Herald and Divine demons in the party. This is very useful for Mastema who does not have Light Pierce until panel 4.
Panel 4 also provides a 15% damage boost to all Herald and Divine demons in the party (himself included). This is very useful for Archangel teams in both PvP and Democalypse.
Yellow gives him access to discounted Mediarahan, allowing him to double as a healer in PvE.
Very good set of resistances, especially in Teal.","Weak to Dark unless Teal.
Expensive to fuse (only 5+5 fusion paths are available).
No Pierce until Panel 4 and overall mediocre stats.
Does not have Speedster innately which in turn consumes a skill slot.
Needs Panel 4 to be good in PvP, requiring a lot of investment.
Mostly helps as a speedy demon that might help trigger Aniel without chain effects triggering Demeter in PVP.
Soul Judgement being random target is ill-suited for PvP, especially considering Light is commonly covered by Anti-Pierce (for example Pales + Demiurge).
Red is not suited for Democalypse boss, since it may cause AI to use Thunderclap instead of Soul Judgement, resulting in less damage output.","-"
"Mithras","YRP","YP","4","4","4","4","5","Covenant Bless is an incredibly overloaded passive, granting Fire Pierce and Light Pierce, and debuffing the enemy team to receive 40% more Fire and Light damage, deal 40% less Fire and Light damage, and every time any demon, ally or enemy, uses a Fire or Light skill, he chains a 40 BP skill of the same element on a random enemy, while also healing himself that same amount. When paired with units that do large amounts of Fire and Light damage like Elohim and Sukuna-Hikona, he does a large amount of damage while simultaneously massively amping up the damage they do.
The Fire damage increase works against Demeter's damage reduction, helping his team pierce through her bulwarks.
Mark of Punishment is a ST 240 BP skill that picks between Fire and Light, depending on the situation, while also ignoring Endures.
236 Magic puts him at the 4th highest magic in the game, and his kit and panels do a good job boosting his Fire and Light damage as well.
His healing and innate HP% in skills and panels can help him survive longer to do more chains, and keep debuffing the enemy.
Strong awaken skills in Tar Flexi and Radiant Light, giving him and his team even more damage potential.
Is devastatingly powerful in Democalypse boss waves, as the constant 40 BP chains really add up.","165 agi is quite low for a T1 team, he can be vulnerable to being outsped.
Random target and only 40 BP on his chain makes it hard for him to focus down an important enemy.
Demeter aggravates this issue, making him more of a liability on defense teams, as he may just undo any damage done by building bulwarks for her.","Epitome of Wisdom 2 is a wonderful translation issue."
"Moloch","R","RP","3","3","3","5","5","Moloch is a unique anti-revive demon that through his skill Blood Cradle, punishes any revive units by making revives only have 1 HP, and once per turn, follows up revives with a 120 BP fire chain, near certainly guaranteeing the revived units will die.
On top of this, the skill also grants Fire Pierce, Null Bind, 70% max HP, 20% personal fire damage, and a 40% fire damage aura for the team, making him a powerful fire demon and giving him high power in fire democalypse.
Quivering Flames emphasizes the role of a fire sweeper with 280 BP Fire skill with remnants, that ignore endures, inflicts Bind on all enemies, and scales off 30% of his HP, meaning the tankier your Moloch is, the more damage he does. Innate Fire Debuff helps with both the damage and making sure the ailment hits.
Red also grants an aoe skill also scaling on max HP in All-Consuming Furnace
Intimidating Stance in purple gives him good synergy with Gozu-Tennoh, fulfilling the full two press turn denial.
Null Mortal and an automatic Barrier Break in P1, more HP and Bind recovery rate reduction in P2, and more fire damage and HP in P3 creates a solid set of panels that help his role as a tanky ailment demon that scales with HP.","The most powerful revive demon in the game, Maria, is no longer a must have in every T2 team anymore. By this fact alone, a massive chunk of Moloch's power is immediately neutered because he's a counter to a demon that isn't used as much anymore.
Ailments are in a tricky spot right now because Demeter offers such strong ailment protection and Moloch doesn't have multi-hit skills to help potentially pierce that like Botis or Indrajit.
While he can function in a midrange team, or even in a fast team, it's hard to work especially in the current Camael meta as of writing.
Fire damage isn't meta right now, so his 40% fire damage aura is mostly unused in pvp as well.
In PvE content where there aren't revives, he's not particularly special either.","If revives become more popular, he could see more use but for the meantime, he's not the best pull.
Has an interesting T1 comp with Unit 01 Dx2 Type, P1 Tiamat A, Moloch, and Hachiman, where if the rest of the team is swept by The 10th Angel, he has enough press turns left to counter sweep."
"Mot","P","YRP","3","2","1","5","5","His high bulk pairs well with Harmonious Death, letting him ramp up his damage and generate more turns in extended fights.
Harmonious Death's extra press turns makes Mot a must-have in Democalypse Prelim teams. At Panel 3, he generates even more press turns and becomes perfect for Democalypse Boss teams.
High bulk plus Life Surge in Purple means it's easy to manipulate his AI into buffing for the Boss phase.
At Panel 4, he casts a 1-turn Debilitate at the start of his team's turn, just like the star Democalypse generalist Lucifer. This combined with manual buffing allows for full offensive buff swing.
Has two strong AOE spells.
Amazing set of panels that provide him MP reduction, Null Mortal, even more Press Turns, and fast-Debilitate.","Weak to Elec.
High MP costs.
The damage boost from Harmonious Death resets when clearing a wave.
Extremely low damage even with Harmonious Death's damage boost for PVP. Offers nothing but bonus turns for his team against Demeter.","Regarding Democalypse:
If he's panel 3, use him in Boss. If he's not, use him in Prelim.
He should go last, so the extra press turns go to your damage dealers. His AGI isn't very high, so this shouldn't be hard to achieve - but Trail brands can help as extra insurance."
"Motoko Kusanagi","P","TY","3","2","2","2","1","She is essentially an entire Ailment Team neatly packaged into one demon. Not only does Ghost Hack remove Barriers, it also has a high chance of inflicting Bind and Mute, in addition to only costing 5 MP to cast. With Panel 2 unlocked, this further chains into a Tarukaja and Sukukaja buff.
At the end of her team's turn, Optical Camouflage hits every demon suffering an ailment with a Piercing Phys AOE. This damage can be further ramped up by the discounted Charge she gains in Yellow.
Due to how packed her kit is, she can easily be splashed into teams looking for some Ailment control, or in Defense teams to catch players randoming without sufficient Ailment protection.
Panel 3 gives her increased Battle Speed, allowing her to act as a pseudo-Speedster.","Her damage is fairly underwhelming due to a low STR stat and lack of any damage boosters in her kit.
Hard-countered by Ailment immunity, most notably Demeter and Maria
Can be used to punish fast teams running without Demeter and Maria but those are few and far between.","Yellow discounts Charge to 5 MP. With Divine Brands, she can cast both Ghost Hack and Charge on the same turn going first. This is not possible against Alice A without some MP support though.
Limited-time Collaboration unit. Nobody knows if she will be rerun."
"Mother Harlot","TYP","TYP","2","2","2","1","1","Babylon Goblet drains MP from all enemies while providing her MP sustain, allowing her to loop the same attack over and over even without Divine Brands. With Panel 2 unlocked, she will additionally spread charm all over the enemy's team.
Panel 4 drains another 1 MP at the start of the enemy's turn.
Teal gives her Drain Phys, ideal for pairing with Rama. Notably, she is one of only two Drain Phys units that can function as a magic sweeper.
Has access to discounted Debilitate in Yellow, letting her play a more support role if needed.
Works very well in a slow Ailment Team, or with Alice A in MP denial teams.
Incredible set of Panels. With Panel 3 unlocked, she can keep enemies permanently charmed by reapplying Charm each turn.","Weak to Force.
Full Almighty kit means she is shut down hard by Five Elements.
Low AGI and high MP costs makes her unsuitable for fast teams.
Offers very little in the Demeter meta other than a bit of mp drain, with the downside of creating a bulwark due to the damage.","The MP drain aspect of Babylon Goblet is less useful for PvE, as the AI has infinite MP. It does allow you to replenish her MP indefinitely though.
As of 2022, she's multi-fusible, but only Common Archetype (Clear) and at an approximate cost of 8 million mag per copy (3 million of that is unaffected by discounts), making it slow and expensive to fully Panel her."
"Mozgus","R","TY","2","3","3","2","2","The only unit in the game that has a Critical Counter, God 1000 Fist Cannon will unleash a random barrage of piercing Phys attacks whenever the enemy scores a crit, that also ignores counters.
Extremely high bulk and damage reduction from Bloody Scripture make him a powerful tank. Building him as a tank also increases God 1000 Fist Cannon and Muscle Punch damage, as they both depend on Phys DEF for damage. Earthquake in Red furthers this synergy.
Yellow gives him access to discounted War Cry, letting him play a support role if required.
Extremely potent panels take him from an average tanky demon to an anti-t1 powerhouse. 70% hp, 650 flat PDEF, 20% accuracy, a start of turn heal, Null Mortal, 25% crit damage reduction, and a Charge effect once per turn when God 1000 Fist Cannon goes off gives him massive potential to counter sweep T1 teams when they crit.","God 1000 Fist Cannon has low base power.
Needs a lot of Accuracy investment due to bad AGI.

Almost dead weight against magic damage, or when the opponent doesn't rely on crits.","Limited-time Collaboration unit. Nobody knows if he will be rerun."
"Murmur","Y","YP","3","2","2","2","2","Duke of Hell provides him damage and ST damage reduction for each open weakness on your party. This gives him a natural spot in Orcus comps, who typically run a large amount of open weaknesses.
Dynamic Evil Spear is a piercing Dark ST nuke with a high crit rate. If it lands, it will also ressurect ALL your allies at 30% HP, making it a pseudo-Recarmdra that can grant a half-turn if you crit. It also provides a 20% accuracy bonus if maxed, which pairs well with his innate Epitome of Aggression and Panel 1 both granting accuracy.
Purple gains access to Null Mortal, whereas Yellow grants him Auto-Sukunda for PVE.
Can get massive amounts of damage reduction paired with Demeter and units like Barong or Beelzebub (Human)","You still receive extra damage from open weaknesses. Fire weakness is particularly annoying against Surt A and Atropos.
No innate damage boosters means he is forced to rely on Duke of Hell for damage.
Difficult to build optimally as he wants both damage and bulk; focusing on one will cause the other to suffer as a result.
Orcus comps are very vulnerable to Mortal, which is rampant in the current PvP Meta thanks to Beelzebub☆.","Dynamic Evil Spear only has 6 charges. Be very careful when using it, as you might end up running out of charges and be forced into a regular attack."
"Nebiros","TP","TP","4","1","1","1","1","Call of the Dead is the only revive skill in the game without a usage limit. This enables infinite revives, especially if paired with healing supports like Nadja.
As Call of the Dead triggers at the end of the enemy turn, it lets you start yours with full Press Turns, and proc any start of turn chain effects like Archangels.
Hand of Glory provides AOE Curse + Luster Candy on ally death. The Curse is a great setup for Alice A (and his own passive), while the buffs increase your likelihood of surviving the turn.
Second highest Luck in the game paired with innate Epitome of Madness makes him a great Dodge tank.
Panel 2 grants Null Mortal which makes him even harder to kill.","Hard countered by Null Curse and demons like Demeter and Maria who make it hard to ailment teams. Offers almost nothing when his Curse is blocked.
Call of the Dead can be mitigated by a Cleric removing Curse before the end of the turn.","-"
"Nergal","RP","P","1","2","2","4","2","Plague of Babylon removes Barriers and has a very high chance of landing Weak and Poison status, making him an incredible setup for Ailment Teams.
High STR, Auto-Tarukaja in Purple and increased Accuracy from Meslamtaea make him a decent Physical demon, especially when Paneled.
Team-wide Auto-Rebellion upon inflicting Poison boosts his damage and synergizes with Pale Rider.
At Panel 4, deals AoE Phys damage upon Poisoning an enemy, once per turn.
Nergal is particularly strong against Cleric Angra Mainyu, as he can stack massive amounts of infliction to brute-force Weak through Angra's ailment resistance, which then lets you land your own Ailments to disable him from cleansing.
Panel 4 can trigger Hachiman giving him potential use with Fafnir as a quick sweep.","Weak to Ice.
Ailments fall flat in late/endgame PvE because of inflated enemy stats.
Hard countered by Ailment Cleansers like Daisoujou or Mahamayuri in PvP.
No innate Pierce until Panel 3 is unlocked.
Panel 4 will consume the Rebellion granted by Meslamtaea, unless you inflict poison a second time later in the turn.
Low damage on Panel 4 makes his use with Hachiman difficult as he'll create bulwarks for Demeter.","P3 Samael offers similar barrier break without consuming a Press Turn. This is vital versus double Intimidating Stance Teams, as Nergal consuming a Press Turn means you are left with a single Press for casting a true ailment.
Compared to P3 Samael, Nergal gives your other demons more flexibility in choosing brands, as they can forego Ailment Infliction completely. Weigh the extra Press Turn versus stat flexibility carefully."
"Nero☆","Any","RP","3","2","2","5","3","Overture deals Piercing damage while giving him free Concentrate, letting him sweep hard.
Voltage synergises perfectly with Overture and gives your party attack and accuracy/evasions buffs.
Very good for Democalypse where he does not have to worry about MP issues and can repeatedly spam Concentrated Overtures while on Spell Brands for insane damage.","Hard countered by Anti-Pierce, as Overture will not autocast Concentrate (and by extension Voltage) if the attack hits into NDR.
Mediocre stats, relies on Concentrate from Overture to deal damage.
No ST skills if not in Red.
Red's Ziodyne does less damage to Elec Democalypse Boss than spamming Overture would, so if using him for that, then he either should NOT be Red, or needs Thunder Reign transferred to stop Ziodyne from being cast.
High MP costs and no MP recovery prevents him from spamming his spells freely.","Cannot be used in the same team as the regular 4★ Nero.

Recovery Amp and discounted Mediarahan let her function as a PvE Healer with a decent offensive presence.","Has no offensive skills despite possessing Merciless Blow. Heavily relies on transfers for an offensive presence or at least do more than heal.
Not really better than Amaterasu and Barong as a PvE healer/support.
Only obtainable through Democalypse grinding.","Very good for Dark and Light Alter-World.
As the AI will not cast debuffs in Democalypse, Abaddon A still has an edge over her being able to provide both buffs and debuffs.

"Nyarlathotep","RP","RP","4","3","3","5","3","Demons die when they are killed by Otherworldly Force, a strong force sweeping skill reminiscient of Echidna's pseudo-endure breaking revive sealing aoe. With 218 magic and innate Force Survivor and Butcher, this skill hits hard.
Additionally gains 35% force damage through panels, only further increasing sweeping potential.
Applies the unique ailment Gloom, which cannot be blocked or cleansed. The only way to remove it is death.
Gloom offers a huge variety of effects, debuffing the opponent's hit rate, evasion rate, crit rate, ailment infliction, and ailment resistance.
In addition, while Nyarly is alive, all enemies will take 25% additional damage from magic and deal 25% less magic damage, as long as they are affected by Gloom
With an absurd four repels, he combos well with Demiurge or Atavaka and he also happens to be a Vile demon, helping him fit with Pales. This is of particular note with him countering Koga Saburo well, as force repel is rare.
Offers buff control in P2 when Gloom is applied, helping him contribute even more to the team.
He is of special note in democalypse prelim rounds, where he adds a 25% damage boost to the entire team.","Has no way to reapply Gloom, so if a unit dies and is revived, the benefits are lost.
Otherworldly Force isn't a true endure breaker, so it won't always be able to punch through enemies, especially if they have multiple endures.
Isn't the tankiest demon so he will struggle to survive in slower teams, and if he dies, the magic damage amp on Gloom is lost.
More or less needs Concentrate to do damage to Demeter teams. This makes him more useful as an offense demon over defense, where you can't guarantee his casting habits.","Killing Wind in red can be useful to avoid NDR, and pierces thanks to Crawling Chaos"
"Odin A","P","P","5","4","3","5","5","Chief God's Rage continues the recent trend of massively overloaded passives, granting 100% crit rate, 40% damage boost to damage done by crits, 40% boost to Phys/Elec damage while his team is in Zenith, 30% evasion reduction to the enemy team while they're in Gloom, and at the start of the first turn, puts his team in Zenith and the enemy team in Gloom for 3 turns each. On top of all of this, when striking a weak point, his attacks will not use press turns outside of Democalypse.
Divine Spear Gungnir is the skill that brings his kit together with it doing either Phys or Elec Physical damage to a single target, chaining an aoe attack of the same element after. This skill also has boost levels that go up after use, increasing first the single target damage, and then the aoe damage, doing a massive amount of damage. Since it's physical damage, it can crit, and with 120% innate crit rate, he can easily even crit on the Elec boss in Democalypse.
At the time of writing, Arioch and Chi You especially are popular demons with an elec weakness. When their weakness is uncovered, he obliterates them.
Panels have a good mix of damage and utility, granting a bit of tankiness while also granting phys/elec damage, and a once a turn Charge effect any time his team downs a demon, leading to potential crit + charge situations for even more damage.
His press turn passive is not prevented by Orcus.
Can completely trivialize most of the Celestial fights (except Celestial Huang Long) - just equip Divine brands and a 4 MP skill to hit the enemy's weakness, spam it and you win without them even touching you (though it will take a while).
Incredible synergy with Zeus, who ensures after a cast of Keraunos that the enemy will be weak to elec.","If the foe's weaknesses are covered, his press turn efficiency passive is irrelevant.
Needs his team to be in Zenith and his attacks to crit to get most of his damage boosters.
Is generally only useful in T1 teams for pvp, but 160 agi and no innate speed limits his speed. Compared to Botis, this is by far his biggest weakness.
Chief God's Haki, while a potentially interesting skill, costs too much MP to really see use, especially considering you use this demon mostly to abuse his press turn passive.","Honorary 1/1/1/1/1 for leading to Sega nerfing Tag, ruining one of the oldest strats in the game for cheesing content, Tag Bros."
"Okuninushi","YRP","YP","5","4","4","4","5","Incredibly speedy with 282 agi and +115% battle speed from skills and panels.
Sword of Izumo is a strong 240BP ST attack that ignores endures and has Remnants, so it will always use only half a press turn. With maxed skill level and Panel 1, it only costs 4 MP.
Works as a cleanser since he's immune to ailments, and Sword of Izumo cleanses the team after use. This synergizes with Sword of Izumo's Remnants to conserve press turn use, as well as his high agi to ensure he goes first.
Casts an ATK buff and DEF debuff at the start of his team's every turn. This is the perfect timing for an offensive buff swing in T1, as it comes after start of the 1st turn effects.
Yellow grants a team-wide boost to all magic damage (though not his own), while Purple boosts his own light damage and grants an endure.
Red grants the rare and powerful AoE Mahamabarion, which is otherwise only available from PvP rewards/exchange. Panel 1's -1 MP to Light skills also makes it somewhat cheap, at 6 MP.
Hits surprisingly hard due to innate light or magic damage boosts (total 60% from skills and panels; If Purple then 80%), despite having low MAG.","Hard to sweep in a single turn with Demeter in the meta.
Low MAG stat.
Extremely low VIT stat, plus no HP boosts on panels, means he's incredibly frail. This makes it very hard for him to survive against Tiamat A teams, as they often have multiple chains, making even Purple's endure not enough.
If the team doesn't get ailmented, then he can't get the Concentrate effect from Kunitsukami's Pride. This is especially a problem in Light Democalypse, which does not inflict any ailments.","-"

Very good buff control with War Cry and Nocturne in Yellow.

Due to the way Law of Hell is coded, it will also deny bonus turns gained from a Crit if the attacked demon has a Physical weakness. This ironically makes Slime a great partner for him, as Slime has six open weaknesses including Phys.
Law of Hell will also deny the bonus turn of Remnants if the attacked demon has a weakness to the attack used (example: Elohim uses Solar Flare on a demon that has a Fire weakness). However, if the attacked demon didn't have a weakness hit, then Remnants will receive its bonus turn as normal.

"Ose Hallel","RP","TRP","4","3","3","4","5","Heavenly Sword puts him in a state of Charge and Rebellion after a single cast. This allows him to deal OBSCENE damage by spamming it over and over, especially if you have P2 unlocked for the MP reduction. It also bypasses Endures as a bonus.
Sword of Hallel gains boost levels as the fight drags on. At max level, it autocasts Debilitate at the start of turn, which is incredibly valuable for Phys Democalypse Boss Phase.
Can reliably crit for Press Turns thanks to Heavenly Sword constantly putting him in a state of Rebellion.
Phys Amp in Purple greatly increases his damage output. Teal can be used for Repel Phys if you plan to combo him with Repel Pierce units such as Atavaka.
Red gives him access to discounted Hades Blast, which is extremely powerful when combined with the Charge effect from Heavenly Sword. As a bonus, this also evokes memories of simpler times, where Charge + Hades Blast Teal Ose was all the rage in PvP.","Requires casting Heavenly Sword once to begin the Charge cycle. This mandates one turn of warm up, which can be risky against Intimidating Stance compositions.
Does not gain Charge and Rebellion if Heavenly Sword misses.
Vulnerable to mortal in Demeter stall teams. Be prepared if you plan to use him.","If you spend your Charge and Rebellion on Hades Blast, then you need to use a turn on Heavenly Sword to get Charge and Rebellion back again. For this reason it's best to save Hades Blast until you're sure it will end the fight, or at least kill multiple targets at once.
In auto battle against multiple enemies, his AI tends to just use Hades Blast raw instead of charging it first. Due to this, Red is only going to reach its full potential in manual play."
"Pale Rider","TP","TY","1","1","1","4","2","Plague's levels and boosts from panels sum to 70% Force damage before transfers. This combined with Auto-Rakunda in Purple makes him great for Force prelim in Democalypse, just transfer him a Force AoE.
Casts 100%-chance Poison and 10% HP fractional whenever he uses a Force skill, and at the end of his team's turn. This lets him spam Poison rolls to more-consistently set up Pestilence, without sacrificing damage.
Pestilence deals 50% HP fractional to poisoned enemies the end of the enemy's turn, putting on pressure to either kill him or cleanse it.
If panel 2, Pestilence will also cast Rakukaja and Rakunda.
Panel 4 is very similar to Fafnir's Golden Greed and his own panel 3, greatly enhancing poison damage while increasing bulk against poisoned enemies. If Pale Rider is paired with Fafnir, poison becomes a 35% HP fractional per demon turn, and poisoned foes have to take down two tanky poison boosters instead of one. If they fail to take down Pale Rider in that time, the 50% fractional from Pestilence will likely finish them off.
Perfect synergy with a set-up based sweeper Nergal. Nergal helps by removing barriers, then casting Weak and Poison. If Nergal's Poison doesn't land, then Pale Rider can still exploit Weak through Force-into-Poison casts or the Poison cast at the end of his team's turn. Poison also triggers Nergal's own Meslamtaea passive to grant party-wide Might, and Nergal's panel 4 immediately casts a Phys AoE enhanced by the Might.
Good AGI and high LUK allow him to work as an Evade Tank. Panel 3 also boosts his evasion a little.
Gains the strongest debuff Debilitate in Yellow, letting him double as a debuffer.","Weak to Elec unless Teal.
Ailments generally fall flat in late/endgame PvE because of inflated enemy stats.
Hard countered in PvP by Ailment Cleanser demons and skills, like Daisoujou or Hecate's Lunar Awakening.
Pestilence only kicks in at the end of enemy's turn, giving them all the time to cleanse the Poison away or just outright kill him.
Requires a specific team built around him to really work.
Ailments are no longer effective with Demeter and Maria, and his chains also are liabilities against Demeter. No longer useful in PVP.","Great choice for Celestial Gui Xian, as the boss does not reduce fractional damage.
Bosses in Strange Signal are not immune to ailments. For new players, he can be a decent demon to kickstart your Aether farming, since Pestilence's damage is fixed and does not depend on brands or transfers.
Due to the Anti-Ailments nature of the current meta, Pale Rider-centered teams are extremely unsuited for random matches.

Unlike other Racial combos, Vile Glare and Cry of the Poor both work even with just 1 other partner, which allows a lot more freedom in team building.
Incredible synergy with Vile Demiurge - Demiurge helps to fulfill the Vile requirement, while Pales has three Repel and Drain resistances to complement False God and Supreme Creator.
With Panel 1 unlocked and a Rallying Survivor transfer, he can stack up to 85% increased ailment recovery, which means a confirmed Turn 1 recovery from Bind and Charm. This allows him to run a Pseudo-cleric set with a Prayer transfer.

Panel 4 increases Ce Acatls' Return's usage limit to 3, and automatically removes Revive Ban from the team at the start of his team's turn. This allows Quetz to immediately and repeatedly revive and buff allies when it gets to his turn, giving him a role similar to Maria. He's also the only source of Revive Ban cleansing aside from Maria herself, and the only fusible one.
Repel Phys in Teal pairs well with Pierce Negation units such as Alilat or Atavaka.
Has 2 strong AOE spells, 3 if in Red.","High MP costs.
Weak to Dark.
Low Magic stat and lack of pierce wastes his AOE potential, despite having good spells and panels.
Ce Acatls' Return has to be cast manually, and it does not give extra press turns - so if Quetz is the sole survivor when he casts it, then your newly-revived team won't be able to do anything before the enemy's turn.
Since revive-ban cleanse is at the start of his team's turn, if one of your demons somehow gets revive-banned in the middle of your turn, you have to wait for your team's next turn to cleanse it.","The AI in Democalypse doesn't cast Yellow's Concentrate."
"Quetzalcoatl A","RP","P","4","4","4","5","3","Has full Fire Pierce and Fire Amp by default, plus Butcher in Purple. This makes him a strong fire sweeper in Democalypse.
Aztec Pulse is a strong ramping fire aoe, starting at 120 BP and ramping up to 160, while also casting Tarunda and Rakunda. As it gains boost levels, it gains Remnants and Endure pierce. Additionally, with P4 it will revive a teammate with 50% HP twice.
Ce Acatl grants him 30% HP, Null Mortal, a free revive twice per battle, while refunding the Press Turn lost from his death, and giving his team a one turn Luster Candy. This means if a team fails to sweep his whole team, he'll always come back the next turn.
Additionally, when he gets a kill, he grants his team a 20% HP Bulwark, heals 30% of their HP, and removes all revive bans. This gives him decent support utility.
Red gives him access to discounted Trisagion, useful versus Fire Anti-Pierce.
His P1 grants Null Bind, and P3 grants a unique effect where every time a teammate gets a kill, he will do a 100BP fire chain and remove all revive bans.
Works as good bait for Camael's chain effects.","Needs ramp up before he has remnants, meaning it's not always easy to place him in turn order.
Has trouble piercing through Demeter bulwarks without heavy investment.
Fire anti-pierce will wreck his day.
His bulk isn't the highest, and while he can come back from the dead, these days you still want everybody to sponge up as much damage as possible before death to try to survive.","As the Press Turn count is determined at the start of the round, Ce Acatl's Press Turn generation only cancels out the lost Press Turn from his death."
"Rahab","YP","YP","3","3","3","5","5","Enemy of God is a passive reminiscient of Murmur, granting party wide damage reduction when their weak points are struck, along with Tarukaja, Rakukaja, and a self state of Might every time a unit on either team strikes a weak point. Additionally to these party passives, the skill grants 25% damage reduction to Rahab when his weak points are struck, along with 50% accuracy and Ice Pierce.
Sea Dragon's Fury is a 200 BP Physical Ice attack with 50% crit, that has a similar stacking boost mechanic to Mantra, where every buff skill used by the party adds 10BP up to 15 times. This skill also ignores endures and counters.
Intimidating Stance in purple helps solidify his role in tanky slow teams.
Strong panels, especially with P2 granting his party bonus damage when hitting weak points and even more damage reduction when their weak points are attacked.
Protecting teammates against weak point damage is useful especially against Zeus, whose entire identity revolves around making opponents weak to Elec.
65% innate accuracy and even more in panels helps him hit even evasive targets.
Fire Weakness helps him tank Elohim, and having only natural Elec resist will make him weak when Zeus reduces elec affinity, meaning he'll be taking massively reduced damage from two of the meta's biggest attackers.","No Null Mortal and only 40% innate HP boosters before panels makes him vulnerable as a tank when his weak points aren't being struck.

"Rama","TYP","TYP","4","2","2","3","3","One of only two demons that can Anti-Pierce through Drain, and thus an invaluable choice for Drain Teams.
Brahmastra is a three-hit Almighty skill that functions as an Endure-breaker.
Good base stats and no weakness allow him to fulfill a variety of roles, be it support or sweeper. Yellow Rama can function as a good support demon with discounted Luster Candy, whereas Purple gives him Ice Pierce which lets him sweep with Mabufudyne.
Panels 3 and 4 combined offer a 2 MP discount to all AoE or random-target skills, while Panels 1 and 4 combined increase those skills' damage by 65%. This alongside a high MAG stat allows Rama to act as a strong generalist in Democalypse.","Drain Pierce does nothing versus Almighty and Fractional damage, both of which are extremely common in higher tiers of PvP.
Stiff competition from Demiurge, who not only has Drain Pierce but also Repel Pierce and two powerful passives.

Works well in an Archangels Team.","God's Blessing does not deal damage, unlike Uriel and Gabriel's passives.
Needs a team built around him to work.
Weak to Dark unless Teal.
No innate Light Pierce.","God's Blessing pairs well with Lakshmi A, as the heal with trigger Diwali and restore MP to your team. This allows you to circumvent Alice A's MP drain, which would otherwise stop Archangels Teams in their tracks."
"Red Rider","TP","P","2","1","1","2","1","Good STR and decent AGI and LUK means he will hit hard without much Accuracy issues.
Savage Glee, Bloodshed, and panels add up to an impressive offensive boost of 50% Phys damage, 60% crit rate, and 30% crit damage.
Blade of Terror deals consistent Fractional damage based on enemies' current HP, unaffected by buffs. It will also bypass the accuracy check since it is a fractional skill.
Blade of Terror has high AOE Bind chance when maxed and panel 4 (40 + 20 + 15 + 30 = 105%), and can be used Turn 1 due to its low MP cost (4 MP when max level and panel 2).
After the fractional hit and Bind, Blade of Terror follows up with a piercing Phys AoE with 50% crit rate (when combined with the above passives and panels, it has 110% crit rate). As it is a chain effect, you will not lose Press Turns even if you hit into NDR, similar to Atavaka's Enemy Annihilation chain.
Blade of Terror also casts Sukukaja and Sukunda if panel 2, helping accuracy and evasion.
Panel 4 grants him Charge upon any party member killing an enemy, similar to Zaou-Gongen and Yoshitsune's panel 4 effects.","Blade of Terror falls off later in the fight as it is based on Current HP (and is capped against late game targets in PvE).
Since Blade of Terror's Phys AoE is a chain effect, it will always use one whole press turn, even if it crits.
Weak to Ice unless Teal.
Demeter and Maria preventing ailments, along with Demeter's bulwark make Red Rider extremely unsuited for pvp currently.","Buffs and damage boosts only work on Blade of Terror's Phys chain, and not the Fractional damage."
"Sabaoth","TP","Any","3","2","2","5","5","Has midrange potential with Sabaoth's Voice giving him differing effects depending on whether or not his team goes first or second, removing 2 MP from the enemy if they go first and inflicting weak, or giving his team 2 MP if he goes first. Additionally, he gets a Concentrate effect at the start of the round, and opponents afflicted by ailments do 30% less damage.
Sanction not only binds and does 120 BP Force damage that ignores endures, but also has remnants effect and generates a press turn if used on a bonus turn, once per turn. This makes him a good choice for press turn generation with T1 teams, and also is extremely powerful in Democalypse.
Godly Judgement has pretty good synergy with his auto concentrate effect, letting him do a massive ST almighty nuke, both ignoring endures and sealing revives.
Offers minor damage reduction to his team with P2, making them take 15% less magic damage.","Doesn't really offer much when used in midrange or T2 teams. He isn't particularly tanky and doesn't offer utility like Shaddai and Orcus neutering press turn generation, or Chi You counter sweeping teams.
Is extremely slow for T1 teams, with only 200 agi after full infusion.
Only really hits hard once, because once the Concentrate effect is gone, Sanction is a 120 BP nuke and Godly Judgement being almighty is hard to boost. Demeter only aggravates these problems.
Other than democalypse, is often just a decent choice and rarely the best choice for a team.","-"
"Samael","P","P","2","2","2","1","1","Panel 3 is insanely powerful, providing free Barrier Break and Makara Break at the start of the turn without consuming Press Turns.
God's Malice is very good to lock down a single target with multiple Ailments.
Panel 4 casts a mini version of God's Malice at the end of his team's turn (10% chance instead of 30% chance for the four ailments).
Infinite Chakra helps to reduce MP requirements, allowing him to spam God's Malice.
Mana Aid is a great transfer skill.","Weak to Elec.
Countered very hard by Daisoujou clearing his ailments and punishing him for using Charm.
Middling AGI hurts Battle Speed for fast Ailment teams.
Demeter and Maria's presence in the meta severely hamstring his usage.","Great set of Panels that provide additional Ailment Infliction, reduce MP costs and the aforementioned breaks. Easy 4x4 fusion paths make him a good Panel 3 goal to strive toward.
Compared to Nergal, Panel 3 Samael gives you better Press Turn efficiency, but in return all your other demons will require some degree of Ailment Infliction from brands or transfers. Weigh the extra Press Turn versus stat flexibility carefully.
Panel 3 pairs well with Alice A and Nebiros teams, allowing them to land Curse without worrying about Barriers. He also negates Xi Wangmu's Panel 2, as he will continuously break her recasted Barriers at the start of his team's turn."
"Samyaza","Any","YP","4","2","2","2","5","Path of the Mage is both an offensive and supportive passive, reducing the innate cost of his Thunder Reign by 1, giving him force and elec pierce, 20% boost to both force and elec, and reducing the cost of his entire team's magic, ailment, support, and healing skills by 1, allowing his entire team to work better against MP removal.
Thunderforce allows Samyaza to once a turn chain a free Thunder Reign after a teammate (including himself) casts an elec skill, and a free Killing Wind after a teammate casts a force skill. This allows him to rack of massive amounts of damage as his team sweeps. The levels on this skill further increase his elemental damage.
Each awaken skill has its own use, depending on the situation.
Well focused panels that increase his damage output, reduce his costs even further, and increase his battle speed.
Relatively high agi of 201 makes him a decent pick for an elemental sweeping T1 comp.
Two innate repels and a third in teal can help him cheese PvE content.","Not the best pick for PvP, because HP totals are so inflated that the additional force and elec damage just isn't enough to take down tanks.
As his chain effects will hit random targets when he's on defense, he can't focus a specific target down when he's not being played manually on offense.
Demeter makes this issue even worse.
Two weaknesses is a liability. Additionally, his teal awaken skill covers neither.
While he's got decent agi, and a little speed in his panels, he's far from as fast as the fastest demons in the game, meaning he can get outsped.","-"

Panels give him and his teammates even more damage. Can be used in an Archangels team if banking solely on Uriel and Gabriel's passives.","Only obtainable through Democalypse grinding.
High MP costs make him unsuitable for anything outside Democalypse.
Weak to Ice.","The best way to build him for both Democalypses is by focusing on one element (most likely Light, see below) by transferring its respective Enhancement skill (ex. Light Enhancement) and Master Assassin. As the +10% damage to weak points given by Enhancements affects all the demon's skills regardless of element, this will ensure a +45% on the chosen element and a +30% on the other one (on comparison, a fully-focused Seraph with both an Amp and an Enhancement gets a total of +50% on the chosen element and of 15% on the other one).
His Transcend Stones can be redeemed for Democalpyse Coins, so make use of that to unlock skill switches. This lets you give him multiple builds without needing multiple Seraphs.
P4 Michael is a great mate for Seraph in Light Democalypse, as they both give damage boost to the whole party (Michael only to Divine/Heralds) and are both of the Herald race, meaning that you can kick in another Archangel (likely Gabriel), boost their damage and proc their passive, for a stellar amount of damage!"

With P1, P4, and Purple archetype, he can reach 40% Phys damage up and 65% Force damage up.","Pierce is only on Ouas, so Clear's Titanomachia will not pierce.

Very expensive to fuse (only 5+5 fusion paths are available). This is also bad since Kartikeya, one of the most important demons for both PvE and PvP, can only be obtained through a Multi-Fusion involving a Clear Shiva, making it difficult to panel them both at the same time.

His revive punish isn't as good as you might expect against Maria and Echidna, because those revives activate at the end of your turn and his punish is current hp based and can't kill, meaning you're vulnerable to being counterswept.
Something that is very unintentionally popular are demons paired with Demiurge who also happen to possess innate Repel Dark or Drain Dark (for example Masakado, Beelzebub☆ and Beelzebub (Human)).

Impregnable is a loaded passive that adds Light Pierce, grants a 100% hp bulwark for 3 turns at the start of the first turn, grants 20% HP, and at the start of their own turn, does a 100 BP bulwark piercing light attack, and does a one turn Debilitate every time this demon does a magic or fractional attack.
Gains damage, self healing, Null Mortal, and party damage from panels, making it a loaded set of panels.
Incredibly powerful at farming BoS S14. One of the key demons for doing faster clears.","In pvp doesn't quite do enough to always be a good choice. When competing with demons like Demeter, The 10th Angel, Camael, and Maria, it can be challenging to slot her into a team.

It's difficult to overstate how much she can increase the team's bulk, especially against teams without Bulwark Pierce.
If you try to take down her team first, every time a teammate dies, she chains a Rakunda effect, then does a 140 BP almighty chain that pierces bulwark, scaling off of 30% max HP. This can easily sweep a team, especially a frail T1 team, even through Demeter's bulwark.
Ray of Ruin continues the almighty trend, being a 100 BP almighty aoe also scaling on 30% HP, with remnants and bulwark pierce. Additionally, when it is successful, it does an additional 150 BP ST chain on the enemy with lowest HP, and both hits ignore endures.
Demonic Growth in purple grants 20% almighty damage boost and a free Endure as well.
Her panels grant healing, damage, Null Bind and Null Charm, along with HP, giving her everything she could ask for, especially as bind stops her chain effects.","Demons like The 6th Angel and Indrajit have ways to fight her Rejection chains, causing her to potentially nuke herself.

Thunderous Hammer is a strong Elec physical attack, doing a 150 BP hit and a 125 BP chain, starting with 50% crit rate. As it gains boost levels, the crit rate scales up to 100%, and the chain effect goes up to 150 BP, making it potent in pvp and Democalypse alike.

P1 grants much need accuracy, turns Demonic Sword in a 4MP skill, which is incredibly valuable against Camael, P2 grants full Sukukaja buff swing at the start of turn, and P3 grants more damage and accuracy.
Being able to bulwark pierce helps a massive amount against The 10th Angel, because she can pierce through 10th's bulwark and damage hp directly, meaning the rest of the team isn't fighting against their 40% damage reduction at full HP.","The damage chain going off only once a turn hurts sweeping potential
If only one demon on your team has bulwark pierce, it can make it hard to actually use it effectively because the rest of your team still needs to push through Demeter's full bulwark, and if you never break through the bulwark, you're always fighting against her 20% damage reduction when a unit is under bulwark.
Not having Phys Pierce is an issue against Camael. Often 01 will be the unit affected by his start of turn chain, and even with MP support, 01 will not be able to cast Demonic Sword on their first action.

Nirvana is an absurd ability that ramps up over his turns, dealing 120 BP Light AoE and more importantly, giving his team an additional press turn once a turn, letting him massively increase his teams potential. It also additionally ramps up to 160 BP and ignores endures, making it an incredibly powerful sweeping skill. It was also buffed to give a 1 turn Debilitate effect on Boost level 2.
Tar Flexi joins Suk Flexi in skills that grant a team a variable advantage whether or not the team went first.

Incredible in light democalypse and in certain situations, any democalypse, as press turn generation is king.","Anti-pierce with Light really shuts him down, preventing him from doing his main roles of damage and press turn generation. This can make him less useful on defense and for randoming in PvP.
God of Ubiquity can be easily stopped by Dark Anti-Pierce, something that is very unintentionally popular as there's so many demons that get paired with Demiurge who also happen to possess innate Repel Dark or Drain Dark (for example Masakado, Beelzebub☆ and Beelzebub (Human)). Because of this, AOE Dark damage tends to be useless or at least unreliable for pvp.
The automatic Dark AoE has further problems against Demeter teams, as it'll trigger her to re-cast Bulwarks. If Vishnu's damage isn't high enough, this could result in a net gain of bulk for her team.
A fire weakness and only Null Fire in teal means he can be vulnerable to demons like Adramelech.

On top of those effects, when attacking first, as well as when Teardrop is used, she casts a one turn Tarukaja and also places her team in a state of Zenith. Whenever she enters a state of Zenith, she also heals 20% hp to the whole party.
Teardrop is a single target 180 BP Ice attack with Remnants. When it is successful, she also casts a one turn Debilitate. Due to her passive, this skill will also only cost 4MP when maxed, meaning it can potentially be cast even when affected by Spirit Chains (Indignation).
Ice Accele helps her team go first, and Solar Downfall helps her control buffs if this isn't a concern.
The heal on her passive creates a powerful T0 comp with units like Ardha, Kangiten, and the Lakshmi A and Mithras combo. All of these units have effects that happen after a heal, letting them chain massive amounts of damage before the enemy can retaliate at all.
Top tier for Ice Democ as her buff control is exceptional and her damage boosters are massive.
Useful panels that offer additional speed, damage, as well as some extra HP and HP recovery.
Good for BoS Avarice as ice is one of the two needed elements.","Ironically because ice units aren't generally the strongest, outside of PvE content, her ice supportive abilities aren't especially useful. She's stronger as a healing chain starter for T0 comps in PvP.

Panel 2 increases his team's accuracy and damage against weak points, and his innate Wretched Blow increases his own damage against weak points. Further, he casts a 100BP AoE when any party member hits a weak point, and generates a press turn (once per turn).

Automatically casts a 100BP ST attack at the start of the enemy's turn. This can chain into effects such as Hachiman's Jingu's Divine Light, potentially offering a lot of offensive pressure before the enemy can act.
This ST attack can help counter Bulwarks on the enemy team, as their Bulwarks will wear off at the start of their turn - leaving their HP bars exposed.
All of his colors have a use, but for general purposes Purple is best.
Trivializes a lot of PvE content, due to opening up an Elec weakness where normally a weakness would not exist.

Sweet Whisper casts Rakunda and Charm when an ally is killed. This can combo well with auto-revivers such as Xi Wangmu, forcing the enemy to prioritize killing her or else risk getting Charmed with every kill.
Since Sweet Whisper chains off of an ally death, it will usually happen during the middle of the enemy's turn. Ailment cleansers tend to act at the beginning of the turn, to avoid losing press turns to ailmented allies - so Sweet Whisper can trip up attackers mid-onslaught, unable to cleanse until cycling back around to the cleanser (if they don't lose all their turns doing so), or even forcing them to wait until the next turn entirely.
This is especially potent if the cleanser is Mahamayuri, who can only cleanse via a chain effect at the start of his team's turn - meaning mid-turn there's nothing he can do about it.
Power of Life gives auto-Lydia to help survivability.","LUK is pretty much her only good stat, so ailmenter is the only job she can do.

He loses his niche of double karns in late PvE and PvP due to the prevalence of Pierce.

Synergy with Lucifuge in Yellow.","Suffers the same issues that Black Frost has in PvP that being Rama + Masakado and Atavaka + Hecate
Stats are subpar even with panels other than MAG.
Unless he's paired with Angra Mainyu or any other demon with an MP recovering effect that triggers at the start of own team's turn, Gluttony can't be used T1 in PvP.
Requires P3 for Dark Pierce.
Something that is very unintentionally popular are demons paired with Demiurge who also happen to possess innate Repel Dark or Drain Dark (for example Masakado, Beelzebub☆ and Beelzebub (Human)). Because of this, AOE Dark damage tends to be useless or at least unreliable for pvp and therefore, hindering 4 star Beelz's usefulness.","Cannot be used in the same team as Beelzebub (Human) or Beelzebub☆.
Beelzebub and Black Frost are comparable when it comes to dark damage but Beelzebub at full potential does the most overrall, which requires Panel 1, 2 and Lv 5 Gluttony
Since Gluttony can't be used T1 and his agility is mediocre for a fast team, the only option is to build him for a slow team which could work well because of the HP drain but could also cause battle speed issues because his agility is a bit too high even for a slow team"

Surprisingly fast despite being a dude encased in ice, making him a decent choice in speedy teams, especially with panels.
One of the few Repel Ice demons (in Teal) as well as the cheapest one, giving him a niche if combined with Alilat against specific PvE Bosses.","Struggles against bulkier demons like Hecatoncheires and HP sponges in PvE.

Full Phys Pierce on panel 1, as well as MP reduction for Phys skills.
The Cat Spirit's Gift restores 3 MP to a party member and grants them Repel Almighty Magic, once per turn. If cast on a sweeper, this could allow them to cast a nuke early on turn 1 to get a kill, then guard against retaliation-on-kill effects, such as from The 10th Angel.
Damage Panel Immunity for Aura Gate.","All stats other than his AGI are bad. Offers no bulk and no damage.
Does not have Speedster innately which in turn consumes a skill slot.
After restoring MP once for the turn, he doesn't have much to do. Low offensive stats, the low-power skill Bleeder, and no damage boosters means he's not great at attacking.
Faces stiff competition from Jeanne d'Arc, who can restore 3 MP as many times as she wants per turn, on top of healing and buffs.
PvE doesn't really need the MP regen, since you start battles with 10 MP. While more MP is helpful in wave-based battles, there are several better MP battery units you could use instead.
Panel 2's MP regen to random party members is so unreliable that it might as well not exist.
Difficult to panel due to being a banner-exclusive 4★ (need 12 dupes total for panel 3, can't use universal spirits, etc).
Weak to Force unless Teal.","Good gacha skills on offer, so you may want to fodder him for those instead of actually having him on a team.
Fenrir is probably the better speed demon in most cases - he's fusible while Cait is not, he has Speedster innately while Cait needs a transfer, he outspeeds Cait (unless Cait is panel 3, but good luck getting there), and he has slightly-better offense with higher Strength and Nihil Claw.
Cait's AI insists on using The Cat Spirit's Gift on the demon who acts first in the party (often himself), regardless of Cait's transferred skills or AI tendency setting. It also values the Repel Almighty Magic effect more than the MP recovery effect, even if the target is at full MP while a different ally is at low MP."

Nastrond is very strong in Offense PVP as the AI may not target him first. This allows him to survive popular Turn-1-Kill-Defense Teams reliably. Transfer him Recarmdra to turn the tables.
Decent LUK stat makes Mahashibabooon a decent transfer, which is to be cast before Recarmdra to make sure the revived allies won't die (Turn-1-Kill-Teams do not use Anti-Ailment techs).","Fairly passive due to serving a primarily supportive role, especially against teams with anti-ailments/cleansers.

Strong mage in early PvE with even skills like Agi and Bufu.","One of the slowest demons in the game and doesn't gain much of note by going second.
Also one of worst LUK stats in the game while also having Mahamarin Karinon making it a wasted slot.
Weak to Elec.
Auto-Sukuka albeit a great skill isn't so much on Oberon for his role.","If using him against Democalypse boss, be aware that Twister in Red is a gamble compared to Zandyne: Twister can have 110, 165, or 220 power based on whether it does 2, 3, or 4 hits (depending on RNG), while Zandyne is always 160 power.

"Sonic","RP","P","2","1","1","2","4","High AGI and innate Speedster for Battle Speed needs.
Automatic Rebellion for himself at the start of his team's turn, and pierce on Spin Dash if he's in Rebellion when using it.
Works well against single targets and particularly Democalypse Force Boss, especially since Rebellion lets him crit despite the boss's crit rate reduction.
Purple gets Force Boost to improve Spin Dash's damage.
Red gets discounted Vorpal Blade, which does respectable AoE Phys damage, especially when in Rebellion. This can result in more-consistent damage than Spin Dash, if fighting multiple targets. Note that it will not pierce, though.
Good panels that give additional accuracy, Force damage, and battle speed, as well as a 1-turn Auto-Sukuka.
Good synergy with Hell Gongen, which grants pierce to Vorpal Blade, ensures Spin Dash gives itself pierce, and ensures Sonic gets the accuracy boost from his panel 1.
No weaknesses.","If he gets a second attack on his team's turn, he won't have Rebellion for it, which then means Spin Dash won't pierce. His middling LUK also means he likely won't crit without Rebellion, either.
Average STR.
Random-targeting is bad against multiple targets, and downright detrimental in PvP.
Panel 3's damage boost is only for Force, so it doesn't affect Vorpal Blade.
Difficult to panel due to being an event-exclusive 4★ (need 12 dupes total for panel 3, can't use universal spirits, etc).
If you just want a PvE speed demon, consider fusing a Yatagarasu for DPS, or Purple Fenrir for support. They have much better mileage than Sonic.","Limited-time Collaboration unit. Nobody knows if he will be rerun."

Needs Light Pierce (weak) or Panel 3 against Light-immune demons
Relies heavily on Ziodyne after God's Bow uses are up... Making Light Pierce (weak) feel like a wasted slot.
Resetting battles over and over to get good rolls can be tiring.
Weak to Force unless Teal.","Not good for Light Democalypse, as God's Bow has only 2 uses (attackers are expected to act 6 times, not considering press turn generators). Transferring Thunderclap does not fix the issue, as the only damage booster in his kit is a measly 5% on panel 1."
