"Metatron","Highest grade demon with the unique skill Fire Of Sinai (FoS). FoS hits really hard with guaranteed 5 hits (+1 if you're using Eileen enabling you to activate her skills), and so quite amazing for boss killing. He comes naturally to boot with Infinite Chakra for extra mana so you would be able to spam tons of spells with him without needing divine brands. He's the hardest to fuse as the only combination to make him is Vishnu + Barong and for this reason i wouldn't fuse him away (regardless of his archetype, his base kit works wonders).","Endure, easily stacks with Enduring Soul further adding to his survival. Megido/Megidola/Megidolaon. For aoe sweeping, you can then use FoS to clean up/for single targets. Go Megido if you do pvp and want a turn one aoe, Megidolaon for turn 2 start/pve in general. Serial Killer/Butcher. Not only does it affect Aoe skills, it also affects Multi-Hit, so you can power up Fire of Sinai's damage considerably.","Brands: Spell/Divine, whichever you want.","Enduring Soul increases his survivability, ensuring he lives means ensuring he can kill. You can easily stack this with Endure to make him really hard to kill. This archetype is the hardest to obtain as you can't rely on gacha pulls to get components and must fuse from scratch (Unless you get lucky with Hell Buns).","Mahamadyne gives him an aoe to use (though is restricted to light). This is amazing for content such as Sloth 10 and Aura Gate.","Offensive Cry is a great offensive buff (granting Tarukaja and Rakunda), he can set up the damage buff leaving your other sweepers to then follow up, hitting as hard as possible. Sadly this is only usable for manual play, due to him being Attack AI he'd never use it on auto","Mana Gain/Bonus is sadly a bad skill in general, there isn't really any reason to save up to 12 mp.","Given he has resist elec in general, Repel Elec for one upgrades it, but it doesn't really do much. The only case where this would help is when facing Thor with Elec Pierce. Pair Metatron with Alilat and you can block elec sweeping. Its a pretty rare case and so it doesn't really warrant switching to Teal just for that purpose."
"Lucifer","Strongest almighty sweeper, ideally you'd want purple archetype (Butcher) to ensure he's as powerful as he can get. The reason for this is that he comes with the unique skill: Morning Star (MS). Given the fact it can be levelled as well it can reach really high numbers.","Resist Light. If not Teal to cover his weakness Endure. Pvp mainly for extra survival. Serial Killer to amp up his almighty damage.","Brands: Use Divine to ensure he can two turn Morning Star.","Vitality Amp III would increase his tankiness, but that is not his main role, he's best as dps.","Mind Blast gives him a upgraded Mind Break for support. You could use it to drain dangerous sweepers of their mp, but why do that when you can sweep them instead with MS/Megidolaon.","You wouldn't really expect him to survive last/be a tank and so Recarmdra doesn't have much use. People would generally aim for him first, so its unlikely he'd survive to the point where he can use this","Nothing else really beats Butcher. It is the only way to increase his sweeping damage due to Morning Star/Megidolaon being almighty.","Drain Light would only be better if you manage to have gotten a Butcher skill genome. It covers his weakness allowing him to be healed instead (You'd want to cover his weakness anyways and so Resist Light would work regardless). Personally if i ever got Butcher, i'd transfer it to another demon and have him as Purple (since the skill itself is really rare)."
"Vishnu","A Strong slow caster with the unique passive Avatar. This acts as an improved Enduring Soul + Life Aid combined into one (500 HP, 50% per wave. It's also levellable). He naturally also nulls light/dark and with his low agi and survival, he can be used in slower pvp teams + pve content such as Sloth 10, Aether farming.","Resist Fire. Covering weakness is always nice Endure/Enduring Soul. If you get these two together, he'd essentially survive 3 extra hits. Though that means enemies would focus fire fire on him.","Brands: Divine for Aragami, Life/Spell works for Protector","Mudodyne is a good skill on him. It gives him more coverage so that he now has Ice, Light and Dark","Megidolaon is the strongest obtainable almighty sweeping skill in the game. -1 MP goes a long way for this. Given his high magic, he'd also hit very hard with it.","Landing him a more defensive role, War Dance grants your team a 5mp cost Rakukaja + Tarukaja. Avatar would ensure he stays alive and War Dance would make your team take less damage and deal more.","Null Mute doesn't help him much, it will prevent his skills from being locked from mute. But when he's inflicted, you could always keep passing until its gone or just cure it (Mute isn't as dangerous as Charm/Bind)","As he naturally nulls dark, Repel Dark doesn't add much. It's an upgrade sure, but the only main use it has is if you pair him with Alilat (it'll prevent him from being swept by Black Frost's: Go To Hell!)."
"Yoshitsune","Immune to light and dark, resistant to phys attacks, has high strength, good agility and high luck to boot for criticals. He comes with the unique skill Hassou Tobi (8x random piercing hits), very useful for bosses and brand farming. Innate skills include Vorpal Blade and Mana Aid, making him amazing in Pve, Mana Aid gives him full MP recovery each wave so he can sweep and repeat with Vorpal Blade/Hassou Tobi.","Phys Boost/Amp. Give him more power. Bloody/Savage Glee. Give him more crit (if not purple) Good/Great Aim. If you find he's missing a lot this can help with accuracy issues. Though you should aim for accuracy % tertiaries from brands. Charge (Optional). To pull off stuff like the Templar Dragon strategy. Butcher. As multi-hit skills count as aoe, this can increase Hassou-Tobi/Vorpal Blade damage. Phys Amp, Boost, Butcher maximises his damage","Brands: War or Divine. Divine would be better for charge/pvp setups, for pve it isn't really needed","Enduring Soul would give him more survivability. Pair this up with Endure so he can take 2 extra hits before dying","Gigantomachia is a direct upgrade to Vorpal Blade, though i feel it is a waste having two aoes on him (Vorpal Blade works anyways). It goes out well with a HB/ZG setup however (due to not needing to worry about criticals) but even so i'd personally recommend the other archetypes over this. God's Hand gives him a powerful single attack skill. Most people replace this as Hassou Tobi can instead be used for bosses.","Charge allows you to ramp up your damage even further; a 5mp charge coupled with Templar Dragon's passive would hit really hard. Auto-Sukuka is a decent auto buff that increases your accuracy and evasion, allowing you to land/dodge hits more often.","Phys Amp boosts his damage greatly allow him to hit really hard, ripping them shreds (To shreds you say?) Savage Glee would add onto his crit rate meaning it'll be quite likely in you getting another turn.","Drain Phys allows you not to worry about reflected Phys damage and, greatly adding to his survivability (Though if he is charmed, he can hurt himself with Hassou Tobi, healing himself with the rest of his skills). Resist Ice can be replaced as he doesn't have an ice weakness."
"Mother Harlot","Comes with 2 unique skills: Death Lust (increased dmg to charmed enemies, chance to charm foes at the start of your turn), Babylon Goblet (BG) (almighty aoe skill which drains 1mp from each target hit) and Mana Gain. She punishes teams without Ward brands and in pve content has a chance to charm enemies every wave. Babylon Goblet is amazing at draining mp out of the enemy team (using her in a Jack Bros setup you can rob them of all their mana, preventing them from counterattacking)","Resist Force. She has a weakness that should be covered. Serial Killer/Butcher. Increases her BG damage since it's almighty based Endure. Gives her survivability.","Brands: Divine to spam Babylon Goblet. Some of the top players use Life to ensure she stays alive as long as possible. Spell if you want Babylon Goblet to do more damage, you'd always start off draining 4mp (effectively reducing its cost to 4 from 8, or 3 from 7 if you maxed it out), though the less opponents alive, the less effective it'll be in returning mana to her. Ward if you're worried of her being inflicted by ailments. Shield would be good otherwise.","Magic Amp III Increases her base magic, this can be decent if you're into min maxing and don't really care about the other archetypes","Deathtouch gives her a single target skill. Be wary though as if you don't use Divine brands, she'd use this over BG. Tetraka Shift helps when starting second, it prevents phys attacks though isn't as good as it used to be due to the prevalent use of pierce","Debilitate allows her to lend support your party (Though you still should be spamming Babylon Goblet when you can) through the best debuff in the game. Since double debuffs exist, Debiliate doesn't shine as much as its essentially the same with an extra debuff tacked on. Infernal Mask is amazing for her due to her natural high luck, greatly increasing ailment infliction/resistance. It also means you don't have to run ward (I would not replace this skill because of its usefulness and rarity)","Stacking Deadly Charm with her passive, would amp up damage done to charmed enemies (Have another demon spam charm to get the best out of it). Insanity will increase her chances of charming enemies overall (this will affect her initial charm passive i'm pretty sure)","Drain Phys is most useful when you have Rama with you (since she has Drain Elec as well), stopping piercing phys hitters and Thor from from sweeping you. Naturally she has Null Phys anyways and so prevents phys aoe in general. Makara Shift is nice defensively for when you start second in pvp."
"Trumpeter","Has no weaknesses and Nulls Light/Dark, he comes with Concentrate, Soul Drain and his unique skill Apocalypse (Almighty, hit all with chance to mute). Given his toolkit he can be used as an alternative on the Jack Bros sweeping team (easier to build compared to Ishtar, less expensive). People don't really run Memutudi as well so they'd waste press turns waiting for mute to go away. The best approach is running barrier break on a demon that acts before him to remove Ward.","Insanity/Madness. Increasing his chance of inflicting mute Endure/Enduring Soul. Gives him more chances do the Concentrate + Apocalypse combo. Serial Killer/Butcher. Increases his Apocalypse damage.","Brands: Divine/Ward. Apocalypse is costly, so be sure to get divine so you can two turn use it. Maxing it out would help with mp cost but this brand setup would still be good for when you want to Concentrate then Apocalypse as soon as possible.","Mahamakajamaon is bad on him. Since Apocalypse already comes with Mute, this skill is a waste.","Judgement would boost your damage though it'd be better just using Tarukaja/having another demon cast it. Evade makes him dodge more attacks which can be good for facing phys units (he naturally has pretty good agi).","Demon Birth Cry is situational and more defensive. Regardless the best approach is using Apocalypse, dealing damage and muting. Auto-Tarunda gives you a defensive head start, good for keeping him and your team alive. Pair this with Purple's Auto-Rakuka and you can easily survive counter attacks (when starting first)","Auto-Rakuka allows your party to start off with a defense boost, this is great in pvp for Jack Bros team setups. With Mute, defense up it's unlikely your team would fall. Trisagion is a powerful single target skill, it gives him something else to use if your team is walled off by Huang Long.","Resist Phys isn't that great. It increases his defense against standard phys attacks but since its not a weakness being covered it doesn't help that much Resist Fire follows the same logic. It's better using stuff like Tarukaja/Rakukaja for damage reduction as they cover all damage, not just a single element"
"Shiva","Strong phys unit built towards aoe, he comes with a unique skill Pralaya (aoe almighty damage based on his strength stat (Levellable with -2 mp cost, effectively reducing its cost down to 6)). He comes with Vorpal Blade and Serial Killer, a weaker version of Butcher but goes well with his two aoe skills.","Resist Ice. If you don't get Teal. Phys Boost. To increase phys damage Bloody/Savage Glee. To increase phys crit chances Endure. For survival Butcher. Stacks with Serial Killer for Pralaya/Vorpal Blade damage boosting","Brands: War if you don't mind waiting for mp to regen otherwise Divine.","Null Charm is decent on him due to rampant use of charm in pvp. With this you can drop Ward brands if you wish, he can still be inflicted by other ailments though.","God's Hand is a really powerful single target skill to use in cases where you can't sweep and want to set your sights onto a single demon (his main focus is still aoe anyways).","Rebellion isn't that great unless you really want to run him with Zaou Gongen (and don't have Hell Biker). Regardless you can instead use Pralaya on the cases where phys pierce doesn't work anyhows.","He has a decent agi stat so Evade can complement it. He comes with Resist Phys anyways so if he is hit by a standard phys attack he won't take much damage. This passive can come in handy when it comes to facing phys pierce demons like Mara, Huang Di or a Hell Biker/Zaou Gongen team.","Drain Ice covers his weakness and gives him drain fire, ice and elec. He'd be healed up by 3 elements which is quite amazing (This would go best with Rama). In covering his weakness you are then free to customize two slots."
"Mot","Mot is a tanky caster coming with Megidolaon, Mamudodyne and Harmonius Death, a really useful passive (Every second turn he gains 10% damage (cap = 50%) and an extra press turn). Naturally he repels Force and Dark, meaning if you pair him up with Alilat you can prevent Cu Chulainn + Black Frost sweeps. Given his unique passive, stats and the fact he also resists phys and fire he's a really good defensive demon in pve and pvp content. The longer he's left alive, the more dangerous the enemy team becomes. Note it takes two turns for a 10% jump and so it'd take 10 turns to reach 50%. This is unlikely to be reached in pvp but in pve content such as Kiwami this can prove quite useful depending on who you go up against.","Resist Elec. The intention is that he'd survive as long as possible to keep Harmonius Death up.","Brands: Divine would be good due to his costly skills if you want him to two turn them. Life if you don't really care about that and just want his hp to go as high as possible. Stack MAtk % if you want damage, Life% if you want survival.","Mana Gain gives raises his mp cap to 12. Useless in pvp and not that great in pve","Deathtouch gives him a single target almighty skill. You can be selective with your attacks but generally Megidolaon and Mamudodyne should be enough. Magic Amp III increases his spell damage further, this can be good for min maxing if you're not sure what else to run.","With Judgement he can enhance his support skills with an aoe that does damage and grants the party tarukaja. Given he's attack AI he can't act as a buff/debuffer to take advantage of skills like Fog/Acid Breath and War Cry so this is one way to make him a buffer at least. Auto-Rakuka is always nice to boost up your starting defence without having to spend a turn casting Rakukaja.","With his naturally pretty high life, Life Surge boosts it even higher. Since he wants to be alive for the extra press turn icon you can run Life Brands as well to stack his life up higher and higher. Enduring Soul gives him another life but you should expect him to survive a long time anyways in this archetype.","Null Phys prevents a majority of phys demons from doing damage to you (unless they're with HB/ZG). This can be useful for pvp but I'd say moreso for pve. Resist Elec covers his weakness so you save mag fusing Throne."
"Michael","Magic oriented demon (even though he has both equal magic and strength). Has the unique skill Soul Judgement (multiple hits, light) which makes him a really good demon for Sloth 10, Megidolaon for general sweeping and Life Aid for healing in between waves making him an effective pve demon.","Resist Dark. If not Teal to cover his weakness. Light Boost. To increase Soul Judgement's damage Serial Killer/Butcher. To increase both Soul Judgement and Megidolaon's damage","Brands: Divine if you want two turn Megidolaon, Spell for Soul Judgement spam.","Endure helps with his survivability. Purple would be better though as you can just transfer this skill (and it's relatively cheap).","Thunderclap gives him a powerful single target light skill. In pvp this can be really useful for demons such as Hecatoncheires or in Black Frost Kiwami","Mediarahan can make him an effective healer due to his high magic (only for manual play because his AI is Attack type he will never use it on auto)","Infernal Mask increases his ailment resistance. He has pretty low luck so it can patch up his resistance to ailments. I wouldn't recommend him as a ailment clearer though (Kinmamon/Yellow Persephone is better for that role).","Repel Dark covers his weakness and when paired with Alilat you can ignore Black Frost's Go To Hell skill. This saves you a slot in transfering resist dark and gives him immunity to 4 elements in total."
"Mara","Strong phys unit with a unique skill Hell Thrust (Gee i wonder why its called that), doing multiple hits and having a chance to charm enemies on hit. Naturally Mara has amazing strength and luck but is quite squishy so he can fall pretty easily. He's the only fusable demon in the game with Phys Pierce (Huang Di has it too but is gacha only) and so like the other pierce users in the game, Purple is his best archetype. He also comes with Null Bind (meh) and Titanomachia for sweeping.","Resist Ice. To give him protection. Phys Boost. So he can hit harder... faster... stronger... better.","Brands: Divine/Ward. Both Hell Thrust and Titanomachia costs 7 mp, so you can't two turn them with War. Though if you don't mind waiting, then War would strengthen his damage further.","Megaton Raid gives him a single target skill i guess. Even so go for Purple.","Mara is a physical unit so Soul Drain won't do much at all. Regardless so go for Purple.","Charge can be transfered and even with the -1 mp cost, it doesn't warrant being better than Purple","Phys Pierce means enemies cannot resist the might of Mara (Pierce just blows out all other archetypes out of the water).","Null Ice would cover his weakness, but then he wouldn't be able to pierce, it wouldn't be worth that cost."
"Izanami","A really strong magical demon with good survivability as well. She utilizes the unique skill Yomotsu Okami which, as long as she's alive Elec and Dark attacks do 10% more damage for all party members. This means she's useful for setups with demons such as Purple Thor (Elec pierce) and Black Frost (Go To Hell! has dark pierce attached to it). Even without them, she herself comes with Bolt Storm and Merciless blow meaning if you face a elec weak demon they'd get fried to a crisp.","Resist Fire. To cover her weakness Elec Boost. Goes well with Elec Amp, though if you take resist as well you'd be conjuring Bolt Storms all day and night. Dark skill. To take advantage of her passive Dark boost. Pair with Red or a dark skill if you don't want to cover her weakness.","Brands: Spell is fine since Bolt Storm doesn't cost much. For Aragami, Hell Gaze will cost 6mp, go with Divine if you want to use it off the bat in pvp. Life is also good since she's quite bulky.","Life Surge increases her tankiness, though this'll be the hardest to get unless you're in luck with hell buns or have tons of mag to fuse clear 5* demons.","Hell Gaze goes well with her unique passive and is quite powerful too, 180 power with -1 mp cost will hit hard.","Concentrate would pair up well with a single target skill (given she doesn't pierce).","Elec Amp boosts her elec damage even further. You would either stack this with Elec Boost + cover her weakness or cover her weakness and go with another skill","Repel Ice would go well with Alilat to prevent Purple Rama from piercing your team. She naturally has Null Ice however so this is not that great."
"Alice","Dark oriented unit with Mamudoon, Mudodyne and her unique Die for Me! (DfM) (Kills a single enemy, one use only). Yup, she can kill anyone she points her finger at and so she's really good for shutting down dangerous opponents and can hit hard provided they don't have dark immunity as that's all her base kit relies on.","Resist Light (If not Teal). she should have her weakness covered. Dark Boost. Increase her dark damage further, if you run it with Purple, then she's stuck with dark skills only (provided you covered weakness) Megido (If not Clear/Yellow). As she only uses Dark skills, Almighty can be used when you face dark immune/resistant opponents. Any other element would work too, but almighty would be best.","Brands: Divine/Ward helps you charge up for DfM as quickly as possible, though Spell would work as Mamudoon and Mudodyne both cost 6 mp only.","Soul Drain gives her a single target almighty skill, giving her more coverage. Since she's too reliant on dark this is good for when you face dark immune opponents.","She doesn't really need more dark skills so Hell Gaze wouldn't help much in that department. Sure it's an upgrade to Mudodyne, but it leaves less flexibility in your final skill slots (Mudodyne works well enough anyways). Glacial Blast enables her to use ice. Being multi-hit it would be good for bosses but can be stopped by ndr and so it's better generally to get single target to ensure you can land a hit or aoe if you know no enemies are immune.","Necro Dogma gives her an almighty skill to play with, also landing more of a support role (Necro Dogma has a Rakukaja effect) and giving her more coverage. It is quite a costly skill however, so if you want to make the most out of it, it's recommended running Divine brands with it. Epic Recovery is a rare skill, but currently is pretty bad. For defending yourself against ailments, its better to rely on preventing it rather than rng to cure it.","Dark Amp stacks up her dark damage, making it hit way harder Wild Instinct is pretty bad as well. Reducing crit damage taken is not that great (she also has quite high luck so won't be hit by crits that much in the first place)","Repel Light covers her light weakness, granting her immunity as well. She can pair well with Alilat to prevent Light and Dark pierce. Thunder Reign gives her a powerful single target elec skill, so it'll capitalize on her high magic stat and more coverage (which she really needs)."
"Huang Di","The most powerful hero in game with no weaknesses, high strength, high agility, luck, sporting 2 unique skills + Hades Blast. Superior Power (which boosts his accuracy and granting him Phys pierce (!!!) and Yinlong Killer, a sweeping phys skill which adds 50% with high power. With that skillset he's quite devastating in any content and this is probably why (him + Hell Biker/Zaou Gongen setup), you see a lot of anti-phys defense teams in pvp.","Phys Boost. Damage up, sweeping all day and all night Endure/Enduring Soul for more survival so he can bring the pain. Bloody/Savage Glee. If you want even higher chances for criticals Null Phys (If not Yellow). Prevents reflected damage from killing him Butcher. Pair with Phys Boost (or Amp if you're lucky) to increase his damage even further.","Brands: War to maximise his damage or Divine if you want to pull off turn 1 Hades Blast + have 2 turn Yinlong Killer spamming. Life can ensure he's bulky. You wouldn't really need Ward as Purple or pulled Teal but it can act as a safety harness. In that case Aim could be nice against evasion teams or Shield for magic defense.","Life Aid doesn't help that much with him. Due to innate resistances he can take a fair amount of damage, though i suppose this archetype would be better than Yellow's Salvation.","Berserker God is really good for taking out single targets. If you don't run divine, regardless you can turn one attempt to snipe an enemy. Auto-Taruka Saves you using another demon with it. If you have Ananta, then this skill can be replaced if you wish to","Salvation is not that good on him as he is not a caster (and it's too costly). It's unlikely he'd ever use it in auto. Null Phys is what makes this pulled archetype good (and is the only source of a Null resistance that is transferable). If his attack is repelled he won't die to the reflected damage and so you can sweep teams irregardless of Alilat + repel phys. I'd recommend shifting this to another archetype if you can.","Null Charm is amazing for pvp. If he's charmed then chances are he'll take down your own team due to his sheer power. Serial Killer will boost his aoe damage even further but can easily be replaced with Phys boost if you wish (10% vs 15%), or you could run both.","Repel Light prevents deaths via God's Bow, light sweeping (e.g. Mastema) and light piercing when paired with Alilat. Infernal mask ensures he's unlikely to be hit by ailments (I wouldn't recommend removing this due to its rarity and how useful it can be)."
"Huang Long","Arguably the best support demon in the game with resistance to all elements (minus dark, phys), Null Light + high stats (minus strength). His main use is Five Elements (5E) which is an improved version of Makarakarn, reflecting all spells including Almighty meaning only pierce skills/phys attacks can be used. Regardless of the archetype, i would recommend getting him as 5 Elements will make any content way easier. 5 Elements can be countered via Makara Break or Silent Prayer to remove it.","Endure. For pvp and survival Samarecarm. Gives you more support utility Barrier Break. Combine this with a Speedster HL for turn one ailment teams. On his subsequent turns he'd then spam 5E for survival. Speedster. If not Purple and you'd like the skill anyways its still a valid choice on him. A fair investment though as it is 10 skill points and requires you to fuse Kama (or if you're lucky have a Teal pulled Rakshasha). Null Phys. If you're going for the Teal Route, this can further bolster him for pve content and be a surprise for pvp. Dodge/Evade. You should build him for evasion, this just further enhances it. 5E to ignore magic and evasion to avoid physical.","Brands: Divine, you'd want to always have 5E up.","Life Aid doesn't help him that much. Given his innate survivability you wouldn't really expect this to do much.","Energy Drain gives him a single target attack. He's meant to be used for spamming 5E so this may throw a wrench in his ability to continuously spam it (given it has the same mp cost due to being an awakening skill). The most effective way to build him is for support not damage.","Luster Candy allows him to buff your party to boost all stats, what's not to love about that? This can however cause small issues in autoing as he'd likely use this over 5 elements, but in manual play is really amazing, extending his support kit to buffs as well. If you have Amaterasu, he doesn't really need this.","Speedster with his naturally high speed, this would allow your team to reach really high battle speed numbers, ensuring you act first. In pve content its always a good idea for your team to go first and so he helps in this regard greatly. Speedster can be transfered however so you can go with another archetype if you wish (you'd save a fair amount of mag when going with this one, unless you're lucky enough to pull Speedster).","Null Dark means he resists all elements and would be immune to Light and Dark. He can then block Alice, White Rider from one shotting him and naturally would also prevent Ixtab's instant kill (due to 5E). In Deceit 10, when 5E isn't casted he can make Metatron lose turns quite easily"
"Rama","OP demon with no weaknesses (Immune to fire, resistant to ice). Rama comes with Mabufudyne and 2 unique skills: Drain Pierce (Pierce has no effect on demons with Drain resistances, provided he's alive) and Brahmastra (Almighty hit all 3 times). He's the drain version of Alilat's effect and with Brahmastra, is effective against demons that have avatar/endure/enduring soul.","Endure/Enduring soul. As long as he's alive you want Brahmastra spam. Butcher/Serial Killer. The only way to boost his almighty damage, though butcher is only obtainable through Skill gacha. Serial killer can be gotten from Shiva. Ice Boost. If you're insistent on using him as an ice piercer, this can be boost up Mabufudyne's damage.","Brands: Divine. You want to spam spells so this is the only option really, Spell/Life is okay but then you won't be able to 2 turn skills in exchange for more damage/hp.","He's a magic attacker so Hades Blast has no use to him at all","Energy Drain is rather lackluster as you'd prefer using Brahmastra instead. Mana Aid makes him really good in pve, essentially you'd wipe out waves with Brahmastra, regain your mana, rinse and repeat. This would make him a really good demon to use in autoing provided he hits hard enough.","Luster Candy would give you another source of a full buff (Though that's better suited to Amaterasu/Huang Long), he won't use it on auto due to being Attack AI. Concentrate would allow you to use him in Jack Bros setups, charging up to deal high amounts of damage.","Though you'd want to spam Brahmastra, Ice Pierce would go through 5 elements saving you from bringing Makara Break/Silent Prayer. Ice Age could help for single targeting","Drain Ice is an effective counter to other Purple Ramas and can be useful against Makarakarn/5 Elements, Reflect a Mabufudyne off the shield to heal. Null Mute is not that great on him, so it can be replaced."
"Zaou-Gongen","One of the key pieces in the Rebellion + Pierce combo (Pair him with Hell Biker and let them go ham). This is due to his unique skill Kongo Zaou which enables demons with Rebellion (Might effect) to also have pierce attached to their phys attacks/skills.","Resist Elec to cover his weakness Phys Aoe skill if not red.","Brands: War/Divine. Divine would allow you to two turn God's Hand and enables transfering more expensive phys aoe skills (If Yellow)","Enduring Soul increases his survivability but doesn't help that much in this case. The main goal with him is to stack up damage to hopefully one shot pve waves/one turn pvp teams.","Herculean Strike is perfect for when you have Hell Biker with you, gives you a spammable phys sweeping skill to use.","Rebellion allows you to take advantage of his passive without Hell Biker, so he himself can still be a really effective phys demon.","He has okay magic so you can technically build him with spells in mind, Fire Amp would boost his Maragidyne damage up. But given there aren't that many fire weak demons (+ a fair amount of fire immune ones), this isn't that good.","Drain Phys is good if you have Rama, however his best friend is Hell Biker and a phys oriented crew to go alongside him."
"Alilat","Really good defensive demon to use, helping immensely vs piercing units (such as those that can be seen in AG). This is because of her unique skill Repel Pierce, ignoring the pierce effect on units that repel the attribute. She is easy/cheap to fuse, has no weaknesses and really high luck + Infernal Mask meaning she can inflict ailments quite well and be unlikely to be inflicted herself. Due to this you have a lot of freedom in picking how you want to build her, whether a debuffer, ailment caster, or even a healer role from what i've seen.","Samarecarm. For added support. Recarmdra. To surprise people in pvp and give your team a second fighting chance (Run divine in order to be able to use it). Aoe ailment skills except for curse and weak. Charm all, Bind all, Mute all are all valid (This is for pvp) War Cry/Fog Breath/Acid Breath, she can act as a tanky debuffer.","Brands: Divine for ailments or Life for general survival. Aim for HP%, or ailment % if you're using Ailment skills. PDEF % is also valid against phys pierce when you're fighting against Hell Biker teams.","Diarahan for single target healing. This is her only archetype so you're stuck with this anyways.","She's support type so in rare cases Soul Drain could be used. You'd want to build her towards support rather than damage anyways.","Mediarama gives her usable aoe healing (a step up from Diarahan i'd say). With this archetype you can easily build her as a healer.","Mana Gain doesn't help much and isn't that good of a skill in general","Null Phys would be useful for pve content, making her immune to phys attacks means she'd less likely be targeted and be more of a thorn in the enemy's side. Naturally she'd be able to block phys units such as: Seth, Siegfried, Zhong Kui, Nergal, Shiva, Ose from the top of my head."
"Lakshmi","Demon with the highest magic stat in the game. She also comes with a unique skill Lotus dance (60% chance to charm all enemies), given her high luck stat she's almost guaranteed to inflict charm on the enemy team and so can be built as magic dps or ailment slinger.","Resist Force. if not Teal. Megido. To take advantage of her really high magic stat. Megidola/Megidolaon would be if you use Divine brands Madness/Insanity. If you really want guaranteed ailment infliction then you can transfer these too (though i think it may be a bit overkill). It would help against high luck demons like Zhong Kui, Dionysus, Alilat if its crucial that they are to be inflicted. Single target Ice. The main counter to ailments is Kinmamon and some people choose not to cover his weakness, if you could deal enough damage you could lock down their ailment clearer.","Brands: Divine to ensure turn one charms + if you do go with an aoe almighty skill, the ability to spam it. Life for Yellow if you want her to be more defensive. Sick brands are also good for a more slow but higher odds approach.","Mana Gain gives her more mp. Not useful at all sadly.","Killing Wind gives her a single target force skill, its okay but more coverage is always better. On the plus side you can single out enemies with it.","Defensive Cry (Tarunda + Rakukaja), gives her more of a support utility. It's an amazing defensive buff for keeping your team alive.","Insanity is another good choice in increasing her already really high ailment chance if you want to maximise it (perhaps you could even charm a certain rock). Personally i feel her charm chance is already high enough (you could always run ailment %/sick brands anyways), but this archetype is usable regardless.","Null Force will cover her weakness, giving you freedom in customizing the two skill slots."
"Ixtab","The opposite of a tanky demon as instead of surviving as long as possible she'd prefer to die for me due to her unique passive Yaxche. This activates only on the enemy turn as when she dies: her killer is hit by an almighty attack and is killed with a 100% success rate (same effect as White Rider/Alice). This bypasses Endure/Avatar/Enduring Soul, but doesn't activate if her team is wiped out/she's the last to die. On offense you can easily exploit the game's AI to target her by intentionally leaving her at level 1, or having the least defense/hp/mdef so they're tempted to kill her straight away.","Resist Light. Not for the purpose of reducing damage, but instead for not giving the enemy extra press turns. Madness. Good when combined with Yellow's Insanity its a good to go with her. Recarmdra, Samarecarm. Bring back allies if she's being targeted last Any other ailment skills like Charm, Mute, Weak, etc. Barrier break to remove barriers for ailment inflicting (though another demon can fulfil this role)","Brands: Divine, Speed, Spell, Lead combinations all work. Don't give her HP/def/mdef and instead focus on stats like Ailment Infliction, Ailment Resistance, Speed (If you want to act first), Matk % if you want to use her as dps.","Null Weak prevents a already not that good ailment from hitting her. If you build her up to resist ailments this would help in terms that rely on inflicting Weak.","Hell Gaze gives her a powerful single target dark skill. Paired with her gacha skill, you can run her as glass cannon. Assassin would boost up the damage of Hell Gaze and her innate Bufudyne as well.","Mahashibaboon sets her up as an ailment user (she naturally has pretty good luck for infliction). Insanity complements this and there's also the fact that levelling up her passive also increases her ailment infliction rate. Give her other ailments and she can pile them on the enemy team.","Berserker, usually bad (increase damage dealt, increased damage taken), but in her case has the opposite effect. Auto-Rakunda helps in swinging the offensive balance to your side (pair with Auto-Taruka for the best effect) on match start. You can build for magic as berserker would make her hit harder. She has low strength so don't bother with phys.","Null Light covers her weakness which is desired, you wouldn't want the enemy team to get extra press turns off her death (in case they kill her revivers). Mabufudyne gives her an aoe ice skill, its not really needed so up to you whether you keep it or not."
"Samael","Another 5* unit with access to Infinite Chakra. Naturally he also has pretty high stats (excluding strength), repels light and dark but has a elec weakness. He comes with Salvation (same heal amount as Mediarama + prayer effect attached to it, 3 uses), Mana Aid meaning he'd be a really effective pve demon and God's Malice a unique skill which can cause a myriad of ailments to a single target.","Resist Elec to cover weakness Megido/Megidola/Megidolaon. Taking advantage of his high magic stat and his large mp regen too you can use this for sweeping and God's Malice to lock targets down. High MP cost skills that you want to use on a support.","Brands: Divine to get 5mp regen or Spell maximising damage, Life making him beefy","Samael isn't meant to be a phys unit and so Death Counter wouldn't help him much.","Purgatory gives him a multi-hit dark skill, given his best Archetype is purple, this doesn't really compare to it.","Tetrakarn is not that great on him. If you really wanted this on him you can just go purple and obtain it from Azrael, the +1 mp gain would offset the non-awakened mp cost.","Infinite Chakra grants +1 mp regen and allows you to run him without divine brands. With divine brands you can spam out skills really easily and two turn Salvation.","He's weak to elec not fire and so Null Fire won't do much for him"
"Seth","Second highest ATK in the game (losing out to an angry red man), coming with Debilitate (All debuffs in one), Zandyne and his unique skill Ouas (really high single target phys damage, excellent crit rate, with an added 40% healing based on damage done). He's built to be a single target sniping unit.","Resist Fire if not covered by Teal. Phys Boost. Increase his damage further Aoe skill. Good for pve but not that good in pvp (unless you run HB/ZG with him) Bloody/Savage Glee. More added crit is nice, Ouas can become even deadlier against high luck opponents Good/Great Aim. If you feel he has accuracy issues, this can help patch it up.","Brands: Divine allows casting Debilitate and Nocturne easily and spamming Ouas more often for pvp. In pve, war and life work just as well.","Titanomachia with its added crit chance and accuracy upon levelling, can be a good sweeping skill for him if you don't want Hades Blast. Given it gets the -1mp cost treatment it'd cost the same.","Bleeder lands him more of a support phys role. If he's at max hp and you feel that the enemy is close to using a dangerous skill, -2 mp from this could help you swing the tides in your favour (or to keep applying pressure). Note that this is weaker than Ouas and doesn't get the added crit bonus too, but is cheaper to use.","Nocturne can add more support to him. Debilitate + Nocturne would ensure you have the most defensive advantage shifted to you. He is attack AI however and so won't use this on auto, only good for manual play.","Force Amp would boost his Zandyne damage, but he isn't meant to be a caster (due to his number two ranking in strength).","Resist Fire covers his weakness to fire, giving you freedom of customization."
"Barong","One of the worst 5* demons in game (Sharing that title with Lilith), due to having two weaknesses, a lackluster skillset, pretty bad archetypes and mediocre HP/Vit (He has good Agi/Luck at least). Mazionga, Bolt Storm won't do much damage with his low magic and so his unique skill Barong Dance (Aoe healing, same power as Mediarama + buff all effect) is what he has going for him, it sadly though it's restricted to 3 uses.","Resist Force. Cover his second weakness Resist Dark. If Yellow. Ailment aoe skill. Takes advantage of his luck stat which is pretty high Samarecarm. Added revive to his lackluster support kit.","Brands: Divine so he can two turn cast Barong Dance. Life can ensure he's more bulky","Endure is quite bad on him since you want to cover his weaknesses and so he'll be stuck with his dance, elec skills and nothing else extra.","His magic stat is too low to take advantage of Thunder Reign. It doesn't help that he already has two elec skills as well.","Recarmdra could be good as an emergency revive, use Barong dance for buff and recarmdra when your team has fallen","Elec Amp could help if he had higher magic, but given the case his elec skills would be doing low damage even with it.","Null Dark covers one of his weaknesses. Cover his force weakness and you at least get one slot to run whatever you like."
"Siegfried","An amazing physical attacker with no weaknesses, also draining phys. He utilizes Berserker God, Rebellion and a unique passive 'Arms Mastery' (+15% phys damage/phys hit rate, levellable) making him effective at hitting his target without any problems or repercussions from reflected attacks. Given he naturally has Rebellion, he's also good when paired with Zaou Gongen, granting him phys pierce whenever he uses it.","Aoe Skill. Since he doesn't come with one, Hades Blast is good. Phys Boost. for more damage Savage/Bloody Glee. For more criticals if you can't be bothered using Rebellion Endure if using Enduring soul to stack it up.","Brands: War/Life or Divine, he works fine with either. Divine will allow you to turn one Berserker God for pvp.","Hes good at surviving combat and so Life Aid is useless on him. In pvp it doesn't do anything at all for his kit.","Maxing out Titanomachia would help in hitting evasive demons such as Garuda and Yatagarasu. Since an aoe is given to you, you then have two free slots to customize whatever you want. Great Aim would add even more accuracy to his attacks, this should enable him to still hit even when the enemy has the evasion advantage with Sukunda/Sukukaja.","Charge is nice but you'd waste a lot of turns setting up both charge and rebellion. Auto-Sukunda is good but again his accuracy is already pretty high. If you want to replace it, Yatagarasu is another source with that auto skill.","Enduring Soul adds to his survivability, stack this with Endure to give him an extra two hits until death. Myriad Arrows is nice for bosses, though people prefer to just give him an Aoe instead as he has Berserker God already.","Null Force makes him completely immune to Susano-o as it blocks all of his sources of attacks. It can also block Rangda's Mazandyne and since a lot of demons have force in their kits it can shut down a lot of sweeps. Resist Dark can be replaced as it won't really do much on him"
"Ananta","Ananta's main use is seen in pvp due to his auto buffs: Auto Sukuka, Rakuka, (and Taruka when purple). He has Amazing stats: high health, vitality, agility meaning he'd be good at tanking. Also is immune to ice, elec and light which is pretty cool (weak to force). He is the only 5 star in the game without a unique skill, given his use this is fine anyways.","Resist Force to cover weakness Acid Breath/War Cry/Fog Breath. You can then ensure you got all buffs and debuffs up to swing the tables early onto your side. Barrier break. If you don't feel like running a double debuff/have it already covered. Though after barriers are gone, he'd just spam attack and heal.","Brands: Life or Divine. You wan't him to be as tanky as possible and survive. Divine to spam double debuffs, Life for more hp in general.","He's not meant to be a caster and so Holy Wrath won't do much on him. He has pretty good magic however so you can go that route if you want. Holy Wrath isn't that good though.","Mabufudyne gives him a aoe ice skill, but he's moreso suited for support. He'd be stopped in his tracks if there is a ndr ice demon.","He has pretty low luck so won't be able to take advantage of Mahapoismaon much. Even so poison is not that good of an ailment.","Auto-Taruka ensures all 3 auto-buffs come from him and you wouldn't need another demon for for auto-taruka.","He already nulls ice so Drain Ice wouldn't really do much. It can be used to counter Purple Rama if you pair him with a Rama, but that's a niche use anyways."
"Surt","The only source of Fire Pierce, but not that good of a demon as a fire weakness isn't that prevalent. He's mainly seen either with a purple archetype for Fire Pierce or Clear for Intimidating Stance. He comes with a unique skill Ragnarok which is another single target sniping skill (getting 20% damage based on Phys Attack). It will take a lot of investment, but you can get Ragnarok to rain down the norse apocalypse on enemies (It's one of the most powerful skills in the game, 215 base power). With brands prioritized towards Matk %, Phys% secondaries, a maxed out Ragnarok (5 Kasanes required), you can reach pretty high numbers with him.","Resist Ice. To cover weakness Endure. Can work for pvp survival Fire Boost. If you want Ragnarok to be stronger","Brands: Divine and MATK% if you want to spam Ragnarok with Purple or War/Life and PATK% for Berserker God damage with Clear.","Intimidating Stance is for pvp mainly, removes a press turn if your opponent goes first. He is generally paired with Zhong Kui (In levelling quests if you run 2x intimidating stance, you'd always act first).","His magic is too poor to run other spells, Maragidyne included. You'd want pierce anyways","Goodbye Lydia Surt, hello Rattle Surt. This is still terrible on him as it has low base power, is too expensive and sukunda wouldn't even help him much given you want to spam ragnarok,","Fire Pierce enables you to choose any target you like to hurl Ragnarok at.","Null Ice can cover his weakness yup, but like the case for Mara, Pierce (or intimidating stance) is too good to pass up."
"Thor","Quite tanky, has high strength and if purple is our Elec Pierce unit making him able to be built towards phys or magic. He comes with a unique skill Mjolnir hitting 4-5 times with elec damage. Pair him up with Eileen to take advantage of her bonuses. He also has quite nice resistances, resisting phys and light, nulls fire and drains elec. Though on auto he'd attempt to charge a lot so he's better for manual play.","Resist Force. To cover his weakness. Elec Boost. To boost mjolnir damage Phys Boost. If you're running Red","Brands: Divine (focus on MATK% for purple, PATK% for red) so that he can spam Mjolnir/Gigantomachia.","He gets Maziodyne added to his kit, even so Purple is the way to go for our hammer bro.","If you really don't care about elec pierce, he can be a effective phys unit. Gigantomachia is the strongest phys sweeping skill in the game and so -1 mp for it can be really good. His stat spread helps a lot with its damage as well.","Rebellion isn't that great on him since he already comes with charge.","Elec Pierce enables him to rain down lighting to anyone and everyone who doesn't bring along Alilat/Rama. Mjolnir hits really hard and against bosses can strike them down swiftly.","He already nulls fire and so Repel Fire is for the sole purpose of countering Surt (run him with Alilat). Not many people use Surt anyways and so this archetype doesn't serve much use."
"Asherah","One of the tankiest healers in the game with high magic, hp and vitality stats. She however comes with two weaknesses and so you'd need to invest a fair amount to cover it. She has Mediarama for party healing, maragion and a unique skill Mother's Creation which is essentially Samarecarm + Lydia combined into one.","Resist Dark Resist Ice. If not teal. Samarecarm. If Teal to give her another revive skill.","Brands: Divine is mandatory to ensure you can two turn heal.","Sea of Chaos could be useful on her since you're building her Matk% up for greater healing. It'd act as a good offensive skill as it'll damage and reduce enemy defenses.","She already has Maragion and so Trisagion wouldn't add to coverage, you can selectively choose your targets now at least.","Silent Prayer allows her to cure ailments/remove shields, barriers, etc. This skill would be most effective on units who are speedy and act first. Asherah is slow and so if your entire team is ailment stricken and you're relying on her to cure it, they would've wasted turns before she could cure them.","Recovery Amp boosts her healing even further. But then the other slots should be used for covering weaknesses meaning no extra skills to add. You'd get this if you want her to be focused purely on healing.","Repel Ice covers one weakness, giving you the ability to customize the last remaining slot."
"Mastema","High magic and is oriented towards light, making him very useful in Sloth 10 farming. He comes Judgement Light, binding cry and the unique skill Trial Of Hate: an aoe light attack that applies random debuff only when the attack successfully hits all targets. As he repels force and light he naturally goes well with Alilat, get a Teal Mastema and you can additionally repel ice, preventing ice pierce. Mastema also has naturally high luck and so has lesser chances of receiving crits and can be a ailment caster if you wish to use him that way.","Resist Fire. To cover his weakness Megido. If you plan to use him outside of Sloth 10 and want more coverage Single Target Element (besides light) can help with coverage too. Light Boost. If you want to only use him in Sloth 10 or in fights where the enemy isn't immune to light.","Brands: Divine, means more journeys into the Trial of Hate. You can also turn one cast it if you max it out.","Mana Gain doesn't help much. It's not recommended going with this archetype.","He gains Ice Age which can help with his coverage, 180 power with the same cost as Bufudyne.","Though i did say he can be used as an ailment caster, a single target Makajamaon won't be able to do much. If you want to run ailments, go with aoe ones instead.","Light Amp further strengthens his kit, amplifying the intensity of his Trial of Hate and Judgement Light.","Repel Ice gives him another element that he can reflect, though the only ice pierce unit in the game is Purple Rama, so its quite a niche use."
"Amaterasu","One of the best buffers due to her unique skill Tenson Kourin (TK), it has the same effect as Luster Candy but casts Dekunda beforehand so you'd always have 3 buffs on you whenever you cast it. Naturally she repels fire and resists light (weak to elec), comes with Maragion, Tarunda also has really high magic for healing and magic damage. You could build her as a buffer + healer (Yellow) or buffer + whatever you like (Teal).","Resist Elec. If not Teal to cover weakness Samarecarm for more support Megido/Megidola/Megidolaon. Can be a damaging spell to take advantage of her magic Any other magic element","Brands: Divine for two turn Tenson Kourin casts and Mediarahan when Yellow.","Auto-Sukuka can work okay on her, but Tenson-Kourin would be your goto source for buffing/clearing debuffs anyways.","Trisagion gives her a single target fire skill, she already has Maragion so if you do want to use her as a caster it'd be better getting another spell for coverage.","Mediarahan is a very good healing skill and is only usable with the reduced MP cost (8). This makes her a really good support/healing unit, though on auto the AI can be quite funky in making decisions with her.","Magic Amp III increases her base magic for min maxing. She has better archetypes to use, but you can run this if you want a dps oriented Amaterasu.","Null Elec covers her weakness, allowing you to mold her into another role, since you'd have two slots to customize."
"Ishtar","Second strongest caster in the game with Mahamaon, Diarahan and her unique skill Mesopotamian Star: almighty aoe casting Tarukaja and Tarunda when it lands. She's mainly used for a sweeping Jack Bros team in pvp with Yellow Archetype but can also be used in Sloth 10 due to having Mahamaon. She comes with two weaknesses however so there isn't that much customization available, in her case its not really needed as Mesopotamian Star should be more then enough.","Resist Dark. To cover her weakness Resist Force. If not teal Whatever you like if Teal, her base kit is technically good enough. You can go Endure for survival or another element as well if you wish.","Brands: Divine for Jack Bros setup with her Yellow version. Spell can work for Teal.","Samarecarm gives her a revival skill. This is really easy to transfer (through Isis) and even so she's better suited as dps rather than support/healer.","Thunderclap gives her a Hecatoncheires slaying skill (plus for Sloth 10 too). If you don't want to use her in a Jack Bros team this is an okay route to take since Mesopotamian Star handles coverage.","Concentrate allows her to work with Templar Dragon + Jack Bros strategies to nuke. When she does nuke the tarunda effect would help mitigate counter attack damage (in the case you don't finish them off).","Tetraka Shift used to be great in pvp but due to the rise of phys pierce its not prevalent anymore. There's also the fact she's not really meant to be a defensive demon, being squishy she can fall easily and with healing ai she'd prioritize diarahan over dealing damage.","Null Force covers a weakness and gives you the freedom to customize another skill slot. If you're planning to transfer concentrate, yellow would still be better because of the -1mp cost it entails"
"Susano-o","Single target sniper with really high strength but all round mediocre stats as his kit contains Assassin (+10% bonus damage for single target skills), Mortal Jihad and Kusanagi. Kusanagi being his unique skill is fully boosted by Phys ATK and when it lands (single target force) casts Tarukaja. This means most of the time you'd have a damage buff active.","Resist Fire. To cover weakness Force boost. Increasing Kusanagi damage further","Brands: Divine to ensure you can first turn Kusanagi/Mortal Jihad in pvp and spam it more in general. Though War will increase his damage way more for pve, Life if you want survability.","Strength Amp III will further boost his damage for min-maxing. Boosting strength will increase Kusanagi damage as well as Mortal Jihad for enemies immune to force. Given his other archetypes aren't that great, this is the best route to take with him for maximising damage.","Bleeder gives him more of a support skill. Even so its generally better to use Kusanagi and Mortal Jihad when required. The extra crit and accuracy on Mortal Jihad can mean the death of enemies, as well as the Tarukaja effect on Kusanagi.","Charge would ramp up his Mortal Jihad damage, but his main appeal is in Kusanagi, this isn't really needed for him","In pvp everyone covers their force weakness due to him and Cu Chulainn existing. Merciless Blow would be beneficial for small cases in pve where the enemy is weak to force but for the most part force is generally covered.","Drain Elec, when paired with Rama, allows him to stop Cu Chulainn and Thor in their tracks as their pierce will have no effect on him. Both Thor and Cu isn't seen much on defense teams and regardless you'd have to cover his fire weakness."
"Nergal","Phys oriented demon who can be paired with Chernobog to produce devastating results. He has amazing strength, agility and luck so he can dish out hits, crits all day. Naturally he has Berserker God and two unique skills: Meslamtea (+20% accuracy, casts rebellion whenever an enemy is poisoned), Pague of Babylon (Casts Barrier Break then Weak all with 80% infliction rate). With these two unique skills he can also be paired with Zaou Gongen to give his attacks a pierce effect. You'd use him to remove barriers first then inflict weak on enemies, once they're weakened they can easily be poisoned which results in him getting Rebellion. An aoe skill is desired of course in order to sweep.","Resist Ice. Cover his weakness, or not if you want to maximise his damage potential Phys Boost. To increase his damage even further Deadly Poison. Goes well with his passive. Aoe skill. If not Red, can help with sweeping","Brands: War works fine since he doesn't have any costly skills. Divine if you want a more costly aoe.","Strength Amp III would boost his strength for min maxing, nothing that spectacular","Hades Blast gives him the desired aoe with a cheap 5mp cost too. Savage Glee grants him more criticals, though this isn't needed if you're going for poison.","Toxic Sting naturally complements his passive. Assuming the enemy has no barriers and have been weakened, you can Toxic Sting, inflicting poison then have Rebellion casted on yourself. Rinse and repeat. Auto-Sukuka helps in landing hits and increases evasion too so that's always a plus but can be replaced if you have Ananta.","Auto-Taruka is okay on him, but since there are other demons with access to it, its better leaving it to them. Strength Amp III would be good for min-maxing though he'd be better off having his weakness covered + aoe (or phys boost).","He naturally resists light so Null Light, though upgraded won't do much. Resist Ice covers his weakness, so this saves you from fusing an expensive Odin."
"Black Frost","Dark sweeper the unique skill Go To Hell! (GTH), dark aoe with 80% curse effect (that also pierces). He comes with a unique Jaki trait passive Curse Of Anguish which reduces damage taken and increases damage towards cursed enemies. He also has Mabufudyne for ice sweeping too (but his main focus should be dark in all honesty).","Resist Light to cover weakness Dark Boost to strengthen GTH. Deadly curse could also work, but it's reliant on the enemy being cursed in the first place so you'd need to set it up with another demon or just use GTH, on subsequent casts it would be stronger.","Brands: Divine so he can spam his skills since it costs 7mp for Mabufudyne/GTH.","Maragion increases his coverage for the case where there is Alilat/Rama + a Repel/Drain dark unit","Hell Gaze isn't that great on him due to being another dark skill (this time lacking pierce). GTH would generally be better due to the attached curse effect on it too.","Concentrate allows him to charge up to do damage making him another possible demon to run on Jack Bros teams.","Ice Amp would boost his Mabufudyne damage greatly, this can be useful for when you can't use GTH though that should be a rarity.","He naturally resists fire and so Null Fire won't do much for him."
"Cu Chulainn","Recommended sweeper and first 5* demon to fuse in the game. With Force Pierce (Purple only) and Mazandyne he can sweep any pve content like crazy. He also has no weaknesses so you get to mix and match a variety of skills. His main weakness however is his low agi and luck, meaning he can be critted quite easily and won't dodge much physical hits.","Force Boost. To increase his damage further Force Amp. If you got lucky and got it in the skill genome Endure. For pvp if you want survival Mazan. To finish off enemies/enables first turn aoe cast in pvp Zanma L. If you want a single target skill on him (Though this'll lock him into just casting it for pve though, he'd never save up for Mazandyne)","Brands: Divine or Spell is valid. Divine allows him to two turn Mazandyne and spam magic more in general.","Rebellion isn't that good for him as he should be built as a spellcaster as Purple.","Killing Wind gives him a single target force skill, without pierce though this wouldn't do that much.","Since he falls quite easily Recarmdra is a joke on him, its meant for more tanky units.","Force Pierce allows him to ignore resists with his Mazandyne. Pierce is always amazing.","Repel Dark won't do much for him. He doesn't have any weakness and so he doesn't need the dark repel."
"Quetzalcoatl","Demon that can be built to be tanky due to his resistances (He resists all except for ice and elec and is weak to dark, Teal gives him Repel Phys). His base kit consists of Maragidyne, Mazandyne and Ce Actis' Return (unique skill). It acts in the same manner as Recarmdra except its user doesn't die. This is coded to behave like Samarecarm so Quetz will try to cast it as soon as he sees at least one ally dead (so you can take advantage of the AI in that regard). Mainly used for pvp and when paired with Alilat (when Teal) he can stop phys sweepers from taking down your team and bring them back to life when they fall too.","Resist Dark. Cover that weakness Samarecarm. Gives you another resurrection shot. Endure. Gives him more survival as if your team is swept, he can survive and bring everyone else back. Mind Break. He'd annoy people by draining their mp though i'm not sure whether he'd even try to save up for Ce Actis' for this case.","Brands: Life, He needs to be tanky and ideally the last demon to fall, so that he'd bring back everyone else. Divine can work too to ensure two turn Ce Actis' casts.","Poison isn't that dangerous of an ailment and so Null Poison won't help at all","Given he's a Attack AI demon Mahamadyne would give him more coverage (he'd then have 3 elements). This would be good for Aura Gate farming, but Teal is always preferable for pvp.","Concentrate would be a strange choice on him. Sure you can use him as a caster, but he doesn't have any unique skills to take advantage of concentrate (don't think i've ever seen anyone run him with this).","Auto-Tarunda can be viable for him if you intend to run him as a dodge build. This is heavily rng though as enemies can stack accuracy % and land aoes on your team.","Repel Phys allows him to deal with pesky Phys units, when paired with Alilat. It also makes him really hard to kill in pve content."
"Orcus","Demon designed and built for tankiness with two unique abilities centering around weaknesses: Law of Hell prevents the enemy team from getting extra press turn icons when a weakness is hit, whilst Hell's Gate grants damage reduction depending on the number of weak attributes your team has (3% per weakness, max 30%). Naturally he comes with War Cry for debuffing and 2 weaknesses himself, meaning by default you get a 6% damage reduction bonus (though this applies only to aoe/multi-target skills). Pairing him with Hecatoncheires would grant you an extra 15% damage reduction and if you don't cover Hecaton's weakness then in total they share 27% damage reduction. So if you do cap out on damage reduction (by bringing demons such as Slime, Abraxas, Arahabaki, etc) this brings it up to a total of 45% essentially halving all damage done. With this strat however, single target skills will still do standard damage to you.","Samarecarm/Recarmdra to bring back allies since your goal is to keep him alive as long as possible Dekaja to be a counter against Ananta buffing via Tenson Kourin/Luster Candy","Brands: Life ensures he survives as long as possible, though Divine can work too so that he can spam out War Cry as much as possible and two turn Samarecarm/Recarmdra skills.","Tetrakarn isn't that great in today's climate because of phys pierce, there are better archetypes suited to him compared to this.","Mamudoon is not too good for him since he's not good for Magic DPS (He's Support AI anyways). Auto-Tarunda is a good skill however, so if you pulled him as Red, i'd recommend switching to another archetype, keeping Auto-Tarunda.","Nocturne is another supporting skill to use to enhance your team's defense and evasion. Coupled with the Tarunda effect from War Cry, once both buffs are up you'll be taking quite miniscule aoe damage. Null Bind is okay and not that great, you can replace it.","Tetraka Shift can stop first turn phys, giving you one turn of breathing room, though in higher pvp people generally bring pierce phys demons anyhows. Hell Gaze is pretty bad using the same reasoning as Mamudoon.","Null Phys makes him immune to phys attacks which is really good in pve, in pvp it can have its uses as well for blocking damage from phys demons such as: Siegfried, Seth, Zhong Kui, Shiva (provided he doesn't Pralaya), Yoshitsune. When facing a Hell Biker team, you may be able to survive long enough for all 3 uses of Red Zone wear off, making him immune to their team, as they are oriented towards aoe phys. Vitality Amp III can be replaced unless you don't have any other skills you want to run."
"Garuda","Speediest demon in the game and really squishy. He has high luck and magic meaning he's built for evasion and turn one kill pvp teams. Repelling Fire and Nulling Force means he'd be really useful in Vanity 10 where the final boss there is Quetzalcoatl with Mazandyne and Maragidyne. Naturally he also comes with Auto-Rakunda and Vanaha (+15% evasion, +30% ailment resistance) further solidifying those points before. Given the ailment resistance boost he'd have low chances of being affected by ailments. Garuda in pvp can be used to help face against Hell Biker defense teams, with the highest agility in game + the bonus to evasion, he should be able to easily dodge phys attacks. Take Yellow for Fog Breath and somehow get sukukaja onto your team to ensure you won't get hit.","Resist Ice. Optional, on the one hand covering his weakness would prevent opponents from getting extra turns, on the other he'll die anyways so at least they'd only get one extra turn. Megido for sweeping Magic aoe for sweeping, i think Megido would work best for coverage","Brands: Divine since we want to be sweeping as quickly as possible. This will allow you to turn 1 Megido in pvp. Go for Spell Type if you wanna use him for Vanity 10 (you can then go with Mamudo). Building evasion is another way to go as aforementioned.","Magic Amp III increases his damage, this is good but Purple's Berserker increases it way more","Maragidyne gives him a fire aoe to use alongside Zandyne.","Fog Breath is good for increasing evasion against the more phys inclined teams. This reduces the chances of you being hit and damage dealt by dangerous phys demons such as Huang Di, Mara, Siegfried, etc and at the same time increases hit chances of your own demons.","Berserker gives +10% damage, +20% taken. He's going to die anyways so might as well boost his damage? You'd be aiming for sweeps.","Null Light would make him immune to 3 elements, naturally he resists light and dies quite easily anyways."
"Lilith","Along with Barong she's another 5* which is not so good. She has two weaknesses meaning you'd need to cover them (and she'd be costly to invest into). She comes with a unique skill Allure that does dark damage to all and has a 35% chance to charm, this would be pretty good if only there weren't so many enemies immune to dark. Her pretty high luck means the charm would probably stick if enemies are hit, but with such a low base chance it doesn't help that much.","Resist Force. To cover her weakness Resist Light. If not Teal. Megido for more coverage Dark boost for more allure damage","Brands: Spell/Life. Allure isn't that costly at all which is nice (6 mp cost), you can opt for Divine if you like.","Insanity can be used to boost her charm chance. Compared to Luck Amp III, its a 5% difference.","Mind Break is a easily transferable skill that can only be gotten from gacha though. Not really worth it as an awakened skill due to being the weakest single target skill in the game (Its for support rather than damage).","Samarecarm gives her a cheaper revive, she can utilize it as a support ai demon at least.","Luck Amp III increases her luck, adding increased crit chance, ailment resistance, infliction, accuracy, dodge and reducing chances of crits taken in turn.","Null Light covers one of her weaknesses leaving you free reign over the final slot (provided you also cover force weakness)."
